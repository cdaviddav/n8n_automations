  "target_audience": {
    "description": "Busy and seasoned professionals, primarily male, aged 25–50 based in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, the DACH region, and other developed countries. They typically work in a mid-level to senior position—such as a manager, team lead, consultant, or freelancer—and rely on Microsoft 365 (in particular tools like Outlook, OneNote, Teams, To Do, Planner, and Loop) daily in a corporate or hybrid work environment. They are comfortable with technology but know they’re not using their tools to their full potential. They often feel overwhelmed by the constant stream of emails, tasks, meetings, and messages. Although they’re busy from morning to evening, they don’t feel like they’re making real progress. Their digital workspace feels scattered and inefficient, and while they suspect there’s a better way to work, they’re not sure how to improve their setup. They get lost in the tools and struggle to connect the dots—wasting time on repetitive processes, manual task tracking, or context switching. What they really want is to save time, reduce stress, and feel like they’re in control of their day. More than that, they want to create space to do meaningful work that moves their career forward. They’re looking for practical, actionable ways to streamline how they manage tasks, communication, and priorities. Ultimately, they want to feel confident using Microsoft 365 and build a simple, reliable workflow they can stick to—so they can get more done, with less mental friction, and finally finish the day with a clear head and a sense of progress."

  "goal": "Based on a topic input, provide structured research that summarizes the problem, aligns with audience needs, and generates useful angles for the newsletter title and content flow. Research includes also identifying key pain points, the transformation of the reader's situation, and the most effective newsletter format.",
  "tone": "Clear, factual, and practical — focus on simplifying complex topics so the rest of the content agents can use it to create human-centered output."
