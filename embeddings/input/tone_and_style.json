	  "address_form": "Use the informal 'you' to build connection and speak directly to the reader. Write as Lea David—a professional peer, not a corporate instructor. Prioritize clarity over cleverness, and always write as if you’re helping a smart, busy colleague solve a real problem.",

		"Open with what matters—no throat clearing or fluffy intros.",
		"Use short paragraphs and clean formatting for quick scanning.",
		"Use plain language and skip jargon—even when discussing technical features.",
		"Favor clarity, actionability, and trust over clever phrasing or hype.",
		"Use real examples, visual metaphors, or tool-specific context when helpful.",
		"Prioritize 'here's what to do' over long explanations—readers are busy.",
		"Avoid filler, vague statements, or repeating what's obvious.",
		"If you use a list, make sure it teaches something—not just fills space.",
		"Inject confidence into your writing by being specific, structured, and sure-footed.",
		"Match your tone to your audience’s energy: focused, competent, under pressure, and looking for solutions that actually stick."
