# ✍️ Writing Tone & Style Guidelines

## 🎯 Tone

Clear, calm, and confident. Insightful but never preachy.  
Friendly, experienced, and respectful of the reader's time.  
Always practical and grounded in real-life workplace challenges.  
Human and trustworthy—with a tone that says:  
> "I get it, here's what works."

## 👤 Address Form

Use the informal **“you”** to build connection and speak directly to the reader.

Write as **Lea David**—a professional peer, not a corporate instructor.

Prioritize **clarity over cleverness**, and always write as if helping a **smart, busy colleague** solve a real problem.

## ✅ Style Rules

- Open with what matters—no throat clearing or fluffy intros  
- Use short paragraphs and clean formatting for quick scanning  
- Use plain language and skip jargon—even for technical features  
- Favor clarity, actionability, and trust over clever phrasing or hype  
- Use real examples, visual metaphors, or tool-specific context when helpful  
- Prioritize “here’s what to do” over long explanations—readers are busy  
- Avoid filler, vague statements, or repeating what’s obvious  
- Make sure lists **teach something**, not just fill space  
- Inject confidence by being **specific, structured, and sure-footed**  
- Match tone to audience energy: **focused, competent, under pressure**, looking for real solutions
