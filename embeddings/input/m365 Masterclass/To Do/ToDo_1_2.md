# Choose the Right Tool: To Do or Planner?
Before diving into the content, you might be wondering about the difference between Microsoft To Do and Microsoft Planner—and which one is the right choice for you. Both are powerful task management tools built into Microsoft 365, but they serve different purposes and fit different workflows. Let’s break it down so you can choose the tool that best supports the way you work.

First, let’s talk about Microsoft To Do.
To Do is your personal task manager. It’s designed to help you stay on top of individual tasks, plan your day, and track what needs to get done—whether it’s work-related or personal. It’s simple, focused, and perfect for managing your own workload. You can create custom lists, organize tasks by priority or due date. To Do also integrates seamlessly with Outlook, so you can turn flagged emails into tasks and manage follow-ups directly from your inbox. And finally, you can also share lists in To Do for collaboration.

Now let’s move on to Microsoft Planner.
Planner is a team-based task management or even project management tool, built for collaboration and managing larger projects jointly with split roles and responsibilities. It’s ideal when you’re working on a shared project and need to assign tasks, track progress, and manage timelines with a group. Planner uses a board-based layout with buckets and cards—similar to tools like Trello or Asana—so everyone on the team can see who’s doing what and how things are progressing. It’s also integrated with Microsoft Teams, making it a great choice for group projects, cross-functional initiatives, and departmental work.

So which one should you use?

If you’re managing your own tasks, planning your day, working independently, or collaborating with just a few people, Microsoft To Do is your go-to tool. It’s clean, simple, and designed to boost individual productivity without unnecessary complexity.

On the other hand, if you’re running team projects, assigning tasks to others, or need a structured way to manage more complex workflows across multiple people, Microsoft Planner is the better fit. It offers built-in visibility, accountability, and collaboration features that make team coordination easy and transparent.

But the best part is that you don’t have to choose just one.
You can use To Do for managing your personal tasks and Planner for team projects—and Microsoft 365 connects them seamlessly. Tasks assigned to you in Planner automatically appear in To Do, so you always have a complete view of your responsibilities in one place.

And don’t worry—I’ll walk you through exactly how these tools work together in the upcoming chapters, so you can make the most of both without any confusion.
