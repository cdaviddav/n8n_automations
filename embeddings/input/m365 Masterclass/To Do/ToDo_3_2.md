# Never Miss Deadlines: Add Dates & Recurrence
Now, let’s make sure nothing slips through the cracks—by adding dates and setting up recurring tasks.

Writing down your to-dos is a great start, but without a date attached, they often end up sitting in a list… untouched. What usually happens is you see the task, think “I’ll do that later,” and then forget about it altogether. This video is all about how to use due dates and recurrence to make your task list time-sensitive, realistic, and easier to act on—especially when things start piling up.

Let’s start with due dates.
To add a date to any task, just click on the task to open the detail pane. Then click “Add due date.” You’ll get a few quick options like today, tomorrow, next week—or you can pick a specific date from the calendar. Once a task has a due date, it will automatically show up in the Planned smart list, which gives you a consolidated view of everything that’s coming up, sorted by day.

Regardless of the due date you’ve set, you can also choose to add the task to My Day—To Do’s focused daily view. This gives you more control over what you want to work on today, even if the actual deadline is still days or weeks away. Just click the sun icon when viewing a task, and it’ll appear in your My Day list.

Personally, I use due dates in two ways. For time-sensitive tasks—like submitting a report or attending a meeting—I set the actual deadline. But for less urgent items, I’ll often pick a date that simply reflects when I want to see the task again. Think of it like nudging it back into your field of view.

Now, if a task repeats regularly—like a weekly report, a monthly check-in, or even daily habits—you can set it up as a recurring task. In the same detail pane, just click “Repeat,” and choose how often the task should come back. You can select from preset options like daily, weekly, monthly, or create a custom schedule—like every third Tuesday or every two weeks.

Here’s something I really like: recurring tasks in To Do only reappear once you’ve checked them off. That way, your list doesn’t feel cluttered with future repeats—you only see what’s relevant now. It’s a small detail, but it keeps your daily view clean and manageable.

If you prefer not to work with due dates—or if they just don’t fit your style—you can still rely on the My Day feature to stay focused. Each morning, you can intentionally pull in the tasks you want to work on, without being tied to a strict schedule. That said, I still recommend setting due dates for key items when it makes sense. Even if you don’t use them every day, they act as a safety net to make sure nothing important falls through the cracks.
