# Master Your Tasks: Unlock Microsoft To Do in MS 365
For most professionals, staying on top of daily tasks is a never-ending challenge.
We juggle project deadlines, recurring responsibilities, and personal to-dos—often spread across sticky notes, notebooks, emails, calendar reminders, and mental checklists. It’s easy to feel like you’re constantly busy but rarely in control.

But often the real problem isn’t that you have too much to do—it’s that you don’t have a clear, reliable system for managing it all. Many people either try to remember everything in their head or rely on basic task lists that don’t reflect real priorities or adapt as plans change. This makes it hard to focus on what matters most, and easy to let things slip through the cracks.

That’s where Microsoft To Do comes in.
It’s not just a simple list app—it’s a lightweight but powerful task manager that’s tightly integrated with Microsoft 365. It helps you capture tasks from email, calendar, or your own thoughts, and then organize them in a way that fits your real workflow. Whether you’re planning your day, tracking follow-ups, or managing multiple projects, To Do gives you a focused, flexible space to get things done.

It also works hand-in-hand with Outlook, OneNote, and Planner—so instead of having tasks scattered across different tools, you can bring everything together in one streamlined system.

The problem? Most people don’t take advantage of what To Do can actually do. They use it as a basic checklist instead of turning it into a true productivity tool.

This module is here to change that.
You’ll learn how to build a practical task system using Microsoft To Do—from capturing and organizing your work, to prioritizing your day and staying on top of your most important tasks. I’ll show you how to set up smart lists, integrate it with Outlook and OneNote, and create a workflow that supports your goals instead of adding more stress.

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to use Microsoft To Do as your trusted system—helping you stay focused, organized, and in control of your workload every single day.

Just a quick note before we begin: In this module, we’re focusing on the standalone Microsoft To Do app—not the small Tasks add-in that appears in Outlook’s sidebar. While they’re connected behind the scenes, the app offers a much richer experience and gives you full access to all features, like smart lists, file attachments, and integration with Planner. So everything you'll see in this module is based on the full To Do desktop app.
