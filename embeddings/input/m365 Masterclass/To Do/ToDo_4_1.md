# Stay Organized: Create & Group Custom Lists
Now that you know how tasks work, let’s create your own structure where they fit it—with custom lists and groups.

So far, we’ve covered the smart lists that come built into Microsoft To Do—My Day, Planned, Important, Assigned to Me, and Flagged Email. These lists are dynamic. They update automatically based on task properties like due date, priority, or assignment. You don’t organize tasks into them manually—they’re filters designed to help you focus on what matters right now.

But smart lists only give you a view of your tasks. To actually organize and structure your workload, you need custom lists—and, ideally, groups to organize those lists.

A group in Microsoft To Do is a way to organize related lists under one header. You can create a new group by clicking “Add Group” at the bottom right of the sidebar. Just give it a name, hit Enter, and you’re ready to go. For example, I have one group for Admin tasks, one for Projects, and another for Personal items. It’s a simple way to separate different areas of your life or work and keep things from getting overwhelming.

To create a new list, click “+ New List” at the bottom left of the sidebar. Name the list, hit Enter, and start adding your tasks. You can then drag that list into a group, rearrange the order, or move it to a different group as your needs change.

No worries if you need to make changes later on. Just right-click on a group to rename it or ungroup the lists inside. And right-click on any list to rename, delete, pin, or reorganize it.
These small adjustments help keep your structure clean, intentional, and flexible.

Now to recap and get rid of any confusion: Custom lists, at the bottom of your sidebar, are where your tasks live. You control what goes into them, how they’re grouped, and how they’re organized.
Smart lists, on the other hand, are like lenses. They pull in tasks based on specific criteria—like due dates or importance—but they don’t change the underlying structure.

I use custom lists to keep my projects and routines structured, and smart lists to quickly see what’s due, what’s urgent, or what’s been assigned to me—regardless of where the task is stored.
