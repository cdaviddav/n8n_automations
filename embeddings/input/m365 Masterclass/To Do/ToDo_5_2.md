# Automate Repetition: Create Task Templates
Let’s move on and talk about saving time on repetitive tasks—by creating your own task templates in Microsoft To Do.

We all have tasks that repeat regularly or follow the same structure every time—think of onboarding a new client, prepping for a meeting, publishing content, or running monthly reports. Recreating those from scratch each time wastes time and mental energy. That’s where task templates come in.

Now, just to be clear—Microsoft To Do doesn’t have an official template feature. But there’s a simple workaround that I have been using and which works really well in practice.

Here’s how I handle templates for tasks I repeat regularly—like monthly routines or project prep—where the structure stays the same, but the actual content might change each time. In those cases, a recurring task isn’t ideal. Recurring tasks are great when you want the exact same task to repeat—like submitting a timesheet every Friday or running a backup.

But when the task needs a bit of customization each time—like updating different client reports, preparing a new presentation, or reflecting on new data—a template gives you more flexibility. That’s why I create a dedicated list for each template, like “Template – Monthly Review.” Inside that list, I build out the full structure of the task: a clear title, notes, predefined steps—everything I’d want ready when I need it.

When it’s time to use the template, I simply right-click the list and choose “Duplicate list.” That creates a full copy, which I can then move into the relevant group—like “Work” or “Admin”—and add a due date, reminder, or tweak the contents. I make any adjustments in the duplicated version, while keeping the original untouched for next time.

If you have multiple templates, I recommend creating a Templates group in your sidebar. That way, you can keep them neatly organized and collapse the group when you don’t need it. It keeps your workspace clean without losing access to those helpful starting points.
