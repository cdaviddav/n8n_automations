# Keep Context Handy: Add Notes & Files
Now to wrap creating tasks up, let’s make sure they aren’t just a list of things to do—but come with the right context so you don’t waste time searching for it later.

It’s one thing to know what you need to do—but it’s just as important to have the information you need to do it. That could be a meeting link, a reference doc, or just a few key points you jotted down in a conversation. When that context is missing, you either waste time digging for it… or you procrastinate because the task feels vague.

In Microsoft To Do, you can easily add notes and file attachments to any task, so everything you need is in one place when you sit down to work.

Let’s start with notes.
Open any task, and in the detail pane, you’ll see a section labeled “Add note.” This is a great place to include extra context—like a short checklist, key links, instructions, or even the next few steps if you're not using the “Add step” feature. It’s plain text, but super flexible. I personally use it to paste in meeting agendas, or jot down rough thoughts so I don’t lose momentum later.

Now, if your task is tied to a file—like a draft document, an Excel sheet, or a PDF—you can attach it directly to the task. In the same detail pane, click the paperclip icon to add a file from your device. Once uploaded, the file will stay linked to the task so it’s always easy to find. This is great for reports, visuals, contracts—anything you want to reference or update as you complete the task.

Keep in mind, the file uploads are stored in To Do itself, not on OneDrive or SharePoint—so it’s more of a simple, local attachment. If you’re working in a team and need to collaborate on the same file, I’d recommend adding a OneDrive or SharePoint link in the notes section instead. That way, everyone’s always working on the latest version.
