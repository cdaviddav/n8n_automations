# Sync Seamlessly: Link To Do with Outlook
Now, let’s connect two tools that go hand in hand—Microsoft To Do and Outlook.

If you’re like most professionals, your tasks and emails are deeply connected. You read an email and immediately think: “I need to follow up,” “schedule something,” or “add this to my list.” Instead of jumping between tools or relying on memory, Microsoft To Do and Outlook offer a simple, built-in way to sync those actions—so you can turn emails into tasks and see everything in one place.

Let’s start with how this connection works behind the scenes.

If you're using Outlook with a Microsoft 365 account, tasks and flagged emails are already synced with Microsoft To Do automatically. You don’t need to install anything or flip a switch—it’s just built in. That means every time you flag an email in Outlook, it shows up in the Flagged Email smart list inside To Do. From there, you can treat it just like any other task: you can add it to My Day, set a due date, create steps, add notes, or move it to a custom list if you want.

Keep in mind that any changes you make to a task in To Do—like updating the due date or adding notes—will also be reflected in Outlook, and vice versa. However, this only applies to attributes that are supported in both tools. So if a feature exists in one but not the other, it won’t sync across.

Additionally, if you add a note to a flagged email in To Do, the note is not synced to Outlook.

I use the synchronization between To Do and Outlook all the time—especially for follow-ups. Instead of keeping emails unread or dragging them into a “To Do” folder, I just flag the message. It instantly appears in my To Do list, and I can handle it when I’m actually in task mode.

Here’s what’s really helpful: when you click on a flagged email task in To Do, you’ll see the email content right inside the task detail pane. And with one click, you can open the original email in Outlook—making it easy to reply, view attachments, or revisit the full conversation without digging through your inbox. Just note that currently, the email will open in Outlook on the web, and there’s no built-in option to change this behavior to open it in the desktop app.

What’s great about flagged emails in To Do is that you can either leave them in the smart list, or drag and drop or move them into another list—any list except "Planned" or "Assigned to Me." However, if you move a flagged email into a custom list in To Do, keep in mind that it will disappear from the Flagged Email smart list. That’s because To Do converts it into a regular task and places it in the custom list you selected. However, the task still remains linked to the original flagged email, and you’ll continue to see it in Outlook’s To Do bar under flagged items.

The sync remains active—so if you complete the task in To Do, it will also be marked as complete in Outlook, and vice versa.

In addition, the task will continue to sync with Planner under the respective Plan tied to the smart list. So again, marking it complete in To Do or Outlook will also update its status in Planner. It’s a seamless connection across the apps—as long as the task stays tied to the same Microsoft 365 account.

In addition to flagged emails, you can also see all your Outlook tasks in To Do—if you’ve created them from the Outlook Tasks panel. They sync into the Tasks list in To Do automatically, where you can manage them with all the same features: dates, reminders, priorities, and more.

Also, whenever you create a task in Microsoft To Do, it will automatically appear in Outlook’s task list as well—because To Do and Outlook are fully integrated. That means any changes you make in one tool, like updating the title, due date, or marking a task as complete, will instantly sync to the other. It’s a two-way connection, so you can manage your tasks wherever it feels most natural—whether that’s directly in Outlook or in the more focused To Do interface.

A quick tip: if you want to keep your email and task workflows completely in sync, build the habit of reviewing your Flagged Email list each day—either as part of your morning planning or when processing your inbox. And if a flagged email turns into a multi-step task, consider converting it into a full task with steps and moving it into a project list.
