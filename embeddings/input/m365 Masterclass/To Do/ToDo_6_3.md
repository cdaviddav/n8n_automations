# Unify Team Tasks: Integrate To Do with Planner
Next up: let’s talk about how to manage your own tasks and team tasks in one place—by connecting Microsoft To Do with Planner.

If you’re working on larger, maybe more complex projects with others, chances are your team is using Microsoft Planner to assign and track tasks. And while Planner is great for visualizing team progress, it’s not always where you want to manage your personal day-to-day to-dos. That’s where the integration between To Do and Planner becomes incredibly useful.

Here’s how it works—there are actually two different ways a task can show up in your Assigned to Me list in To Do. The first is when someone assigns you a task in a Planner plan, and the second is when someone assigns you a task in a shared To Do list.

Let’s start with the first case: tasks assigned to you through Planner.

Let’s assume there is an existing Planner plan and someone assigns you a task within this plan in Planner—whether it’s in a shared plan, a project board, or a group workspace—that task will automatically show up in the Assigned to Me smart list in Microsoft To Do. You don’t need to set anything up; the connection happens automatically behind the scenes as long as you’re using the same Microsoft 365 account.

This means you don’t have to constantly check Planner to see what’s on your plate. You’ll find those assigned tasks right alongside your personal ones in To Do, where you can manage them using all the familiar features.

When you open a Planner task in To Do, you’ll notice that the task detail pane looks a little different than what you’re used to. You’ll still see the due date and notes section, but there’s also a section in between with links—one to open the task directly in Planner via Teams, and another to open the full plan where the task lives. This is really helpful when you want to check overall progress, read comments from teammates, or update the task status within the full Planner interface.

It’s important to remember that the task is still owned by the Planner plan. So if someone updates the title, due date, or marks the task as complete in Planner, you’ll see those changes reflected in To Do. And it works the other way too—if you update something in To Do, like adding a note or marking the task complete, those updates will appear in Planner as well.

However, note that attributes unique to specific apps, like priority, progress, and bucket in Planner and To Do, or reminders in To Do, don’t sync to the others and vice versa. Also, notes sync differently based on task type: for original Outlook tasks (not flagged emails), notes sync across all three apps via the task’s content text field. For flagged emails, notes added in Planner or To Do sync only between those two, as the email content in Outlook can’t be modified. Finally, your steps in ToDo will be synced as a checklist in a Planner task and vice versa.

Then there’s the second option: when someone assigns you a task in a shared To Do list.

If you’ve shared a list in Microsoft To Do with someone—whether it’s a colleague, a direct report, or even a small team—you can assign tasks to each other directly within that list. To do this, just click on a task, open the detail pane, and use the “Assign to” option. Select the person’s name, and they’ll be notified that the task is now assigned to them.

Once that happens, the task will automatically appear in their Assigned to Me smart list—just like a Planner task would. From there, they can treat it like any other task in To Do: add it to My Day, set a reminder, attach files, or even move it to a different custom list to keep their own setup organized.

When someone assigns a task to you in a shared To Do list, it will also appear in Planner—and show up in two places. First, you’ll find it under “My Tasks” in Planner if you filter by “Assigned to me.”

Second, it will appear inside the corresponding plan, which is automatically created from the shared To Do list. In other words, every shared list in To Do is mirrored as a plan in Planner.

However, there are a few limitations. Planner doesn’t display task ownership in a dedicated column when viewing these mirrored plans. So if multiple people are working from the same shared list, it’s not easy to immediately see who owns what. The best workaround is to use the assignment filter in Planner to narrow down tasks by person and focus only on those assigned to you or specific teammates. You find the assignment filter when you select a plan and on the top right you can select different filters. One of those filters is the assignment filter.

Unlike Planner tasks, shared To Do tasks don’t show links to a board or plan. But everything is updated in real time: when the assignee marks the task as complete or adds a note, it syncs across the shared list instantly. It’s lightweight, flexible, and perfect when you don’t need the structure of a full Planner plan.
