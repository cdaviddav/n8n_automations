# Collaborate & Delegate: Use Shared Lists Effectively
Now that your task system is organized and working for you, let’s take it one step further and talk about collaboration and delegation—specifically, how to assign tasks to others and how to manage shared lists.

Whether you're working with a teammate, a direct report, or just sharing responsibilities with someone else, being able to delegate tasks clearly helps you stay focused on what you need to do—while still making sure everything else moves forward.

In Microsoft To Do, assigning tasks is simple—but there are a few things you should know about how it works.

First things first—you can only assign tasks within shared lists. So before you can delegate anything, you’ll need to share the list with the person you’re working with. To do that, open the list, click the share icon in the top right corner, and send them the invitation link. Alternatively, you can right-click the list in the sidebar and select “Sharing options.” Once they’ve accepted the invite, both of you will be able to add, edit, and manage tasks within that list.

Now, once someone is part of the list, you can assign any task to them. Just click on the task, open the detail pane, and use the “Assign to” option. You’ll see the names of everyone who has access to the list. Click the right person—and just like that, the task is now assigned.

The person will get notified, and the task will appear in their Assigned to Me smart list, making it easier for them to stay on top of what they’re responsible for.

A quick tip from experience: even though everyone in a shared list can see and edit every task, assigning tasks brings clarity. It reduces back-and-forth and makes sure expectations are clear. I use this all the time for small project checklists or shared routines—especially when working with others asynchronously.

Now here’s something important to keep in mind: you can only assign full tasks—not subtasks or steps. So if a task has multiple steps and you want to divide them across different people, you’ll need to create separate tasks or promote subtasks for each person and assign them individually. It’s a small limitation, but it’s good to know so you don’t accidentally assume a checklist item was delegated when it wasn’t.

Let’s also talk about how to work together in shared lists—without needing full project management tools or overly complex systems.

As you saw in the last video, shared lists are a simple way to collaborate without the structure of a full project tool. They’re great for working with one or two people—whether it's for a small project, shared responsibilities, or even non-work tasks like planning or errands. Everyone can contribute, stay aligned, and manage tasks together in one focused space.

Now that you know how to create a shared list, let me tell you that you can also use shared lists without assigning tasks. Sometimes you don’t need formal ownership—you just want a place where everyone contributes. That works, too. You can treat the list as a running backlog, a shared checklist, or a flexible workspace where anyone can jump in and take action.

Whenever a task is completed or updated by someone in the list, those changes sync instantly for everyone. It’s a simple and transparent way to stay in sync—without needing to chase updates.

Just one thing to be aware of: if you or others in the list have notifications turned on for shared list activity, you’ll get a pop-up every time someone marks a task as done, edits something, or reassigns a task. That can be helpful in low-activity lists, but in busier collaborations, it can get distracting. You can manage that in your Settings > Notifications, where you can choose to turn off updates for shared lists at the very bottom to keep things quieter.

And just like with your personal lists, you can organize shared lists into groups, pin them to the top of your sidebar, or color-code them to make them easy to spot.

Here’s a small tip I’ve found helpful: if you're using shared lists for multiple purposes—like one for admin work, another for planning, and one for content—I create a dedicated group just for shared lists. That way, I can collapse them when I’m not actively working with others and keep my sidebar clean.
