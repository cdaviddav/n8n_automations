# Navigate Easily: Explore the To Do Interface
First of all, let’s explore the Microsoft To Do interface and get you comfortable navigating around the app.

If you’re new to To Do, it might seem like just a simple list app—but once you know where everything is, it becomes a clean, focused space to manage your day. So let’s look at the main layout and highlight a few powerful features that are easy to miss.

When you first open Microsoft To Do, you land in the left-hand navigation panel, which is where you’ll find all your lists. This includes built-in smart lists like My Day, Important, and Planned, as well as any custom lists you can create. These smart lists update automatically based on things like due dates and priorities—more on that in the next chapters.

At the top of the list panel, you’ll see My Day. This is a space where you can handpick what you want to focus on today. You can either pull in tasks from other lists or simply jotting down what’s on your mind that day. By default, all tasks due today are listed in My Day as well.

Below My Day, you’ll see Important and Planned. Important shows everything you’ve marked with a star, while Planned includes all tasks that have a due date. Tasks assigned to you from Planner will also show up here if you’re using Microsoft 365 in a work environment, which we’ll explore later in the module.

Then you’ll see Assigned to Me—this is where all tasks assigned specifically to you will automatically appear. These can come from Microsoft Planner, if someone assigns you a task within a team project, or from shared lists in To Do, where someone has delegated a task directly to you. Because assigned tasks often include due dates, you might notice some overlap between the Planned and Assigned to Me lists. That’s totally normal—Planned organizes tasks by due date, while Assigned to Me filters based on ownership. Think of it as two different views of the same data, helping you stay on top of both timelines and responsibilities.

Below that, you’ll see a smart list called Flagged Email. This list pulls in emails you've flagged in Outlook. It’s a simple but powerful way to turn your inbox into an actionable task list without copying anything manually. Once an email is flagged, it shows up here as a task, and you can open it directly in Outlook if you need to follow up or respond. It might be the case that you do not yet see this smart list as it only shows up once you have flagged your first email.

Then there is Tasks, another default list where all new tasks land if you don’t assign them to a specific list. Think of it as your general inbox for to-dos. You can leave tasks here if they’re quick and simple, or move them to a dedicated list once you’ve decided how to organize them.

Below that, you’ll find your own custom lists and groups—these are the spaces you create to manage projects, personal routines, recurring checklists, or anything else that needs its own structure. How to set them up, customize them, and how I personally use them will be covered in the next video.

Clicking on any list brings up its tasks in the main panel. This is where you’ll spend most of your time. You can add new tasks by typing into the “Add a task” field at the bottom. Once a task is added, you can click on it to open the details pane on the right. Here, you can add due dates, set reminders, break it down into steps, or attach notes and files. We’ll go into all of those in the next lessons.

One small detail I really appreciate: To Do autosaves everything. You don’t need to hit “Save” anywhere—just type and move on. It’s simple and feels really light.

At the top left of the app, you’ll find the search bar—useful when you’re trying to find a task across multiple lists—and the settings menu, where you can tweak things like themes, notifications, and connected apps.

Before we move on, there’s a quick tip that can make organizing your tasks much easier. You can move tasks between your custom lists simply by dragging and dropping—just click and hold a task, then drag it to another list in the sidebar. It’s a fast and intuitive way to reorganize. If you prefer more control, you can also right-click the task and choose “Move task to” from the menu. Both methods help you keep things tidy as your priorities evolve.

Just keep in mind: tasks in smart lists like Planned, Assigned to Me, or Flagged Email can’t be moved directly out of those views, because they’re filtered by attributes like due date, assignment, or email flag. To remove a task from one of these views, you’ll need to change the corresponding attribute—such as removing the due date, unassigning the task, or unflagging the email.
