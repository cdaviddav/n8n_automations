# Spot Priorities: Use Important & Sort Tasks
First of all, let’s talk about spotting your priorities—quickly and clearly—so you’re always working on what matters most.

Even with a well-organized list setup, it’s easy to get caught up in busywork if you don’t have a clear system for identifying what’s truly important. That’s where To Do’s built-in tools like priority levels, sorting, and filters can really help you cut through the noise.

Let’s start with the Important flag.
We touched on this earlier when we talked about setting priorities. In To Do, you can mark any task as “Important” by clicking the star icon in the detail pane. When you do that, it will automatically show up in the Important smart list—giving you a filtered view of your high-priority tasks across all lists. It’s a great way to build a focused shortlist without moving anything out of its original list.

Just a quick reminder: Microsoft To Do doesn’t offer detailed priority levels beyond the Important flag. At first, that might seem like a limitation—but I actually think it’s a strength. It forces you to make a clear decision about what truly matters, instead of defaulting everything to “medium” priority and ending up with a cluttered list.

That’s also why I like to keep my Important list lean. I review it every few days and make sure it only includes tasks I genuinely want to act on this week. If too many things are marked as important, the list loses its value—and the sense of focus it’s meant to provide.

Next, let’s look at sorting.
Every list – except for planned and Assigned to me -  in To Do can be sorted in different ways—by importance, due date, in alphabetical order, or creation date. Just click the three-dot menu in the top right of any list and choose Sort by. This can help you quickly spot overdue tasks, group similar types of tasks together, or keep your list visually structured.

For example, I usually sort all my lists by due date, so the most urgent tasks rise to the top and anything less time-sensitive stays further down. It gives me a quick overview of what needs attention now—without having to scan the whole list.

You can also manually reorder tasks—but only if your list is sorted by Importance or not sorted at all. If your list is currently sorted by something else, like due date or creation date, you’ll need to remove that first. Just click the small X next to the sorting method shown at the top of your list. Once that’s cleared, you can drag and drop tasks into any order you like. This is especially helpful when you want to plan the exact flow of your day or group tasks in a way that reflects how you work best.
