# Personalize Your Workflow: Customize To Do Settings
Now that you’re familiar with the ToDo interface, it’s time to personalize your setup. Customizing To Do doesn’t just make things look nicer—it helps reduce distractions, cut out what you don’t use, and bring focus to what matters most. Whether you want to streamline your sidebar, organize your lists more clearly, or set just the right amount of reminders, this video will walk you through the key settings to shape To Do around your workflow.

Let’s start with Smart Lists—those automatically generated lists like My Day, Important, Planned, Flagged Email, and Assigned to Me.
To adjust which ones show up in your sidebar, click on your profile picture or your initials in the top-left corner and open Settings. Scroll down to the Smart Lists section. From here, you can turn any of these views on or off, depending on what’s useful to you. For example, Completed and All tasks are turned off by default. However, if you would like to have an overview of all your completed tasks, you might want to turn it on.

In addition, you might want to adjust what’s being shown in My Day. Below the Smart lists you can see the toggle to turn on or off that tasks Due Today are either shown or not shown in My Day. Personally, I have turned it off so I can manually decide what’s in My Day.

Below the Smart Lists section, you’ll find Notifications.
This is where you control task reminders and alerts related to shared lists. You can choose whether you want To Do to notify you about upcoming tasks or changes made by others—like when someone assigns you a task or completes one in a shared list. If you’re someone who checks the app regularly, or if you’ve shared a list with just one or two colleagues, constant notifications might become more distracting than helpful. In that case, it’s a good idea to turn off shared list alerts to keep your focus. Otherwise, you’ll get pinged every time someone ticks something off, which can quickly add up and interrupt your flow.

At the very top of the To Do settings, you’ll find a few general preferences you might want to review—like setting the start of your week or adjusting default list behavior. It’s worth taking a moment to go through these and tweak anything that doesn’t match how you naturally plan or work. Personally, I’ve kept most of these settings at their default, but it's helpful to know they're there in case you want to fine-tune your setup later on.

Once your sidebar is cleaned up and your notifications are set, it’s time to tailor the look and feel of ToDo to match your personal preferences.

It may seem like a small thing, but setting the right theme can make your workspace feel much more personal and less like a generic tool. In the Settings menu, you can switch between light, dark, and high contrast modes depending on what feels best to your eyes.

You can also assign individual themes to specific lists. Just open a list, click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner, and choose a background that fits the list’s purpose or mood.

In addition, you can customize each list’s title and icon to make your sidebar easier to scan at a glance. With the list open, click directly on the title to edit it. This lets you rename the list and, if you’d like, select an icon that adds a visual cue—especially helpful once you’re juggling multiple lists.
