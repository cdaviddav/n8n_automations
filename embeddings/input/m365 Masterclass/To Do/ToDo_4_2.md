# Plan Your Day: Master the My Day Feature
Next up: let’s take a closer look at a great feature in Microsoft To Do—My Day.

If you've ever had a long to-do list staring back at you, not knowing where to start, this feature is made for you. My Day helps you cut through the clutter and focus on what matters today. Instead of juggling ten different projects or bouncing between lists, you can handpick the tasks you want to work on right now—and let the rest wait.

As we’ve already discussed, the My Day view is always at the top of the sidebar. What makes it special is that it resets every day. That means you're not dragging yesterday’s unfinished tasks around with you unless you choose to. Each morning, you get a clean slate—so you can plan with intention instead of reacting to whatever pops up first.

Adding tasks to My Day is super easy. You can either create a brand-new task directly in the My Day view, or—what I recommend—you pull in tasks from your other lists. Just open any list, right-click on a task (or click into it), and select “Add to My Day.”

If you prefer a semi-automated way of planning your day, Microsoft To Do offers an option to automatically surface tasks that are due today in your My Day list. To check this, head into Settings, scroll to the Smart Lists section, and look for the toggle that says “Show tasks due today in My Day.”

When this is turned on, any task with today’s due date will automatically appear in your My Day view. It’s a helpful way to make sure time-sensitive items don’t slip through the cracks. But if you prefer to decide what to focus on manually, you might want to leave this off. That way, you can start fresh each morning and build your list based on current priorities—especially useful when things change quickly or you’re dealing with a lot of short-notice tasks.

But don’t worry—adding something to My Day doesn’t move the task out of its original list. It just gives you a focused view, while everything still lives in its proper place. You can think of it as temporarily bookmarking a task for today’s workflow.

Now here’s something important to remember: My Day doesn’t show overdue tasks unless you add them manually again. So if you skipped something yesterday and it’s still relevant, you’ll need to re-add it yourself. That might sound inconvenient, but it’s actually by design—it gives you full control over what your day looks like, instead of overwhelming you with guilt from tasks that carried over.

One more thing: if you want to remove a task from My Day without deleting it, just uncheck the “My Day” option in the detail pane. The task will still exist in its original list, with its due date, notes, or steps untouched.
