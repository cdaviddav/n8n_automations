# Collaborate Better: Bring To Do into Teams
Next up: let’s clear up a common question—can you use Microsoft To Do inside Microsoft Teams?

Right now, the short answer is: not directly.

There’s currently no built-in way to access your personal To Do lists within the Microsoft Teams interface. Unlike Planner, which integrates into Teams through tabs and the Planner app experience, To Do is not available as a standalone app inside Teams—and you won’t find it in the app store or as a sidebar tool.

That said, there is still a way to access some of your To Do tasks within Teams—but only indirectly, using Planner as the bridge. As we covered in the previous video, any task that’s assigned to you in Planner or created in a shared To Do list will sync automatically into Planner, and from there, can be viewed in Teams. So while you can’t access your full To Do setup inside Teams, you can still keep track of assigned tasks and shared work without opening the To Do app itself.

In practice, this hasn’t been an issue for me. I usually keep To Do open alongside Teams—either in a separate window or pinned in my browser—so I can quickly add or adjust tasks without breaking my flow. It’s a lightweight setup that keeps everything within easy reach, even without full integration.
