# Stay on Top: Set Reminders & Priorities
Next up: let’s make sure your tasks don’t just sit there quietly—but actually show up when you need them. That’s where reminders and priorities come in.

Even if your task list is perfectly organized, it’s still easy to forget things when life gets busy. A quick reminder or a clear priority tag can make all the difference between something getting done… or getting buried.

So, let’s start with reminders.
To set a reminder, just open a task and click “Remind me” in the detail pane. You can choose a preset time like later today or tomorrow, or pick a specific date and time that works for you. Once that time arrives, you’ll get a notification.

I like to use reminders for tasks that are due later but need a bit of preparation—whether that means reviewing something, starting early, or kicking off a few steps ahead of time. They help me stay proactive without having to constantly keep track of everything in my head.

Now let’s talk about priorities.
In To Do, you can mark a task as important. Just open the task and click the star at the top right of the details panel. When you mark a task as important, it’ll show up in the Important smart list automatically. This gives you a filtered view of your most urgent or impactful tasks, without needing to dig through every list.

Unfortunately, there’s no finer distinction—just low, medium, and high priority. But in a way, I actually like that. It forces you to make a clear decision: is this task truly important or not? That simplicity helps prevent the temptation to overuse the label and mark everything as important when it really isn’t.

You can also combine reminders and priorities. For example, I’ll often flag a task as high priority and set a reminder for a specific time—especially if it’s something that’s easy to forget but still crucial. This way, I don’t rely on memory alone to get things done.

One thing to keep in mind: reminders don’t reschedule themselves if you miss them. So if you didn’t act on a task when the reminder popped up, you’ll need to manually update it or move it into My Day to keep it on your radar. That’s why it’s helpful to combine reminders with features like due dates or recurring tasks, which we covered earlier.
