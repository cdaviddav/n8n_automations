# Tackle Big Tasks: Break Them into Subtasks
Let’s move on and talk about big tasks—and how to break them down so they stop feeling overwhelming.

We’ve all had those to-dos that sit untouched for days because they feel too big to even start. “Prepare annual report,” “Organize team offsite,” or “Launch new website”—they’re technically tasks, but really, they’re more like mini-projects. This video is all about how to use steps, or subtasks, in Microsoft To Do to turn those big items into something manageable and actionable.

When you create a task, click on it to open the detail pane. You’ll see a section at the top called “Add step.” Each step is a smaller action that helps move the main task forward. Just type a step, hit Enter, and keep going until you’ve outlined the key pieces.

For example, instead of leaving a task as “Organize team offsite,” I’d break it down into steps like: research venues, send out survey to team, confirm dates, draft agenda, and coordinate travel. Suddenly, that big task becomes something I can actually move forward on—one step at a time.

If you notice that a step is becoming too big or its scope has changed, you can easily turn it into a standalone task. Just click the three dots next to the step and select “Promote to task.” It will then appear as a separate task in your list, giving it more visibility and space to manage on its own. And if a step is no longer relevant, you can delete it the same way—just click the three dots and choose “Delete step.”

And if you’re working with others using Microsoft Planner, it’s helpful to know that steps in To Do are the same as checklists in Planner. So when a Planner task is assigned to you and syncs to To Do, the checklist items come through as subtasks—and vice versa. This means your task details stay aligned across tools, making it easier to manage your responsibilities whether you're working in Planner or To Do.

What I really like about steps is that they stay tucked inside the main task. Your sidebar stays clean and uncluttered, but you still get a clear sense of progress. As you check off each step, To Do displays a visual progress bar right on the task—it's subtle, but surprisingly motivating. Even if the full task isn’t finished yet, you can see that you're making progress, which makes it easier to keep going.

There are a couple of important things to keep in mind when working with steps. First, individual steps don’t have their own reminders or due dates—they’re tied to whatever you’ve set on the main task. So if you need time-based reminders or a deadline, make sure to apply it at the task level and then check the steps manually as you go.

Also, completing all the steps in a task won’t automatically mark the main task as done. You’ll still need to check off the main task separately. And the same goes the other way—if you mark the main task as complete, any remaining steps will stay open until you check them off individually. It’s a small detail, but good to know so nothing slips through unnoticed.
