# Find Tasks Fast: Use Tags for Categories
Let’s talk about tags in this video—and how they can help you cut through the noise and find the right tasks, fast.

As your lists grow and you start juggling more projects, it’s easy to lose track of where things are. You might remember the task… but not which list it’s in. Or you might want to see all tasks related to a specific topic—like “invoices” or “calls”—regardless of which list they belong to. That’s where tags come in.

Just a quick clarification upfront: Microsoft To Do doesn’t currently offer built-in tag functionality—but there’s a simple and effective workaround that works just as well.

For those of you who are not familiar with tags, they are just simple text labels you add to a task using a hashtag. You can write them directly into the task title, or add them in the Notes section. So for example, if you want to tag a task for a specific client or context, you just add something like #urgent, #followup, or #clientA.

Since there is no official tag management system in To Do this solution is very lightweight and flexible. But that also means it’s up to you to keep it consistent. Personally, I use a small set of tags across all my lists, and I try to keep them short and meaningful. That way, I can quickly search for a tag and instantly pull up everything related to that category.

To search by tag, just go to the search bar at the top left of the app and type in your tag—like #urgent. You’ll see all tasks that include that tag, no matter which list they’re stored in. This is incredibly useful when you need a complete overview of certain projects or would like to quickly gather information across tasks.

One small thing to keep in mind: how your tags appear in search results depends on where you’ve added them. If the tag is in the task title, the title itself will show up in the main line of the search results, making it easy to spot. But if the tag is only in the notes section, the search result will display the tag on the first line, with the actual task title shown just below it. Personally, I prefer adding tags directly to the title—it makes both the tag and the task name immediately visible and easier to scan when I'm searching.

Just remember: since To Do doesn’t have a built-in tag manager, everything depends on how consistently you use them. Stick to a few core tags that reflect how you like to work, and avoid creating too many variations of the same idea.
