# Pair Notes & Tasks: Connect To Do with OneNote
Next up: let’s connect two of the most powerful tools in Microsoft 365—To Do and OneNote.

If you’re someone who uses OneNote to capture meeting notes, brainstorm ideas, or document your work, chances are those notes often come with follow-up tasks. And while To Do is great for managing tasks, it doesn’t automatically link those tasks to the related context in OneNote—unless you build that connection yourself.

So, let’s start with the basics: Microsoft To Do doesn’t have a built-in integration with OneNote —but you can manually link the two simply using copy-paste.

Here’s how I do it. When I’m in OneNote—say I’ve taken notes during a meeting and identified a few action items—I’ll highlight the task-related part of the notes and create a corresponding task in To Do. In the notes section of the To Do task, I’ll paste a link back to the OneNote page.

To get that link, just right-click on the page in OneNote’s navigation pane and select “Copy Link to Page.” Then, paste it into the notes field of your task in To Do. Now, when I open that task later, I can jump straight back to the full notes with one click.

Just a quick note: by default, clicking the link will open OneNote in your browser. However, you can easily switch to the desktop app by clicking the “Open in Desktop App” button in the top right corner of the OneNote web window.

Even if it’s not automated, it’s quick, flexible, and works. And that’s often just what counts.

In addition to the manual linking approach, there’s another way to connect OneNote with To Do—though it involves a bit of a workaround using Outlook. As you may know, OneNote allows you to create Outlook tasks directly from within a note. Once you create a task this way, it will appear in Outlook’s task list. And because Outlook tasks sync with Microsoft To Do, the task you originally created in OneNote will eventually show up in To Do as well. It’s not the most seamless workflow, but it does allow for a basic connection between your notes and task list.
