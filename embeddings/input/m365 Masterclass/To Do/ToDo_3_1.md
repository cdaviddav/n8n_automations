# Capture Tasks Right: Create Structured To Dos
First of all, let’s talk about how to actually capture tasks in a way that’s useful—not just today, but a few days or even weeks from now.

The real challenge isn’t forgetting tasks—it’s writing them down in a way that’s too vague or easy to ignore. Something like “presentation” might make sense now, but not tomorrow. The key is to capture tasks clearly so you always know what needs to be done and where to start.

Let’s begin with the basics. To add a task in To Do, just open any list and type into the field that says “Add a task” at the bottom. Press Enter, and the task is added instantly. If it’s something quick, that’s all you need.

But if it’s something a bit more complex—or if you want to make sure future you remembers what you meant—click on the task after you’ve added it. This opens the detail pane on the right side, where you can add all sorts of helpful context.

Before adding any details, one of the most valuable habits you can build is writing tasks clearly from the start. I recommend phrasing them as specific actions—like “Draft first two slides for Q2 presentation” instead of just “presentation.” The clearer the task, the easier it is to take action without second-guessing what you meant.

Personally, I try to keep things consistent by starting each task with a verb—like draft, call, schedule, or review. It instantly makes the task actionable and tells me exactly what needs to be done.

Keep in mind that the list where you create a task determines where it lives. If you add a task directly inside a specific list, that’s where it will stay—unless you move it. You can always drag and drop a task into a different list or right-click it and select “Move task to” if you want to reorganize things later.

One tip I’ve found especially helpful: when you’re in capture mode—just jotting down ideas or doing a quick brain dump—don’t worry too much about perfect organization. Use the Tasks list as a kind of default inbox. It’s a simple place to dump everything quickly, and then sort through it later when you have more mental space.

Just note that some lists in To Do—like Planned, Assigned to Me, or Flagged Email—are smart lists, meaning they update automatically based on task attributes. You can’t move tasks into or out of those manually. Instead, if you want a task to appear there, you’d need to update the task itself—for example, by adding a due date, assigning it to someone, or flagging it in Outlook.
