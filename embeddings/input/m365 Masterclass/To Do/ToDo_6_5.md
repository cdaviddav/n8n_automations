# Capture Together: Tasks in Loop & To Do
Now, let’s look at how to use Loop together with Microsoft To Do—so you can turn quick thoughts and shared conversations into personal tasks that don’t get lost.

If you’re someone who likes to brainstorm with others but prefers to manage your own tasks privately, this setup is a great bridge between collaboration and personal follow-through. Loop is perfect for capturing ideas in real time, while To Do helps you keep track of what you actually need to do—on your own terms.

Inside a Loop page or component, you can insert a task list. Just type a forward slash and choose the task list component. Add your items, assign them to yourself or others, and include due dates if you want. The moment you assign a task to yourself, it will automatically show up in your Assigned to Me as well as the planned smart lists in To Do, if you set a due date. You don’t need to create it manually in To Do—it’s synced in the background.

This is especially helpful if you’re collaborating with a colleague in Loop and tasks are being created during that session. You can leave the shared Loop space knowing your assigned action items are already in To Do, ready to be tracked with the rest of your personal list. From there, you can organize them however you want—add them to custom lists, mark them with priority, or include them in My Day.

One thing to keep in mind is that Loop is still evolving, and depending on your Microsoft 365 setup, not all features may be fully available yet. But the task list component already works well with To Do, and it’s a really smooth way to move from group conversation to individual accountability.

Personally, I like using this for planning sessions or quick brainstorming chats. If someone assigns me something during the session, I know it will show up in my personal task system without me needing to make a note or remember it later.
