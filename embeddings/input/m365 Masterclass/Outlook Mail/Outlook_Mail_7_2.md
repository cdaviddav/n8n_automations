# Cut the Noise: Mute Threads with Ignore
Next, let’s talk about cutting out email distractions with Outlook’s Ignore feature. Imagine being cc’d on a long email thread that no longer concerns you, yet your inbox keeps filling up with every reply. What started as a relevant update has now moved far from your area of responsibility. Instead of constantly deleting or marking emails as read, Outlook lets you mute the conversation entirely, so you never have to see another message from it again.
To ignore a conversation, select any email in the thread, then go to the Home tab and click Ignore. You can also right-click the email and choose Ignore from the menu for a quicker option.

A confirmation window will appear, letting you know that all past and future emails in that thread will be automatically moved to Deleted Items. Click OK, and the entire conversation will disappear from your inbox. Any new replies will skip your inbox entirely, keeping things clutter-free.
If you accidentally mute a thread you still need, you can undo it by going to Deleted Items, selecting the email, and clicking Stop Ignoring Conversation in the toolbar. This will move the thread back to your inbox, and future replies will appear as normal.

The Ignore feature is great when you're certain a conversation is no longer relevant, but it does have a downside—it moves all emails in the thread straight to the Deleted Items folder, which can be risky if you later realize you need them. If you’d rather keep the emails but move them out of your inbox and mark them as read, you can set up a Quick Step as we discussed earlier to do it in just one click. This way, you stay organized without losing access to important messages.
