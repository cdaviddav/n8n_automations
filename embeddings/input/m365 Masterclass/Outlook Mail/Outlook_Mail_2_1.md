# Master Outlook’s Layout: Boost Efficiency with Inbox, Reading Pane, Folder Pan and To-Do Bar
First, let me show you how you can improve Outlook’s layout to work more efficiently, reduce distractions, and make it easier to navigate your inbox. A cluttered or poorly configured layout can slow you down, making it harder to find important emails and keep track of your tasks. But with a few simple adjustments, you can set up Outlook in a way that works best for you.

Before we dive into specific adjustments, let’s make sure we’re all starting from the same default layout. I’ll be using the Classic Ribbon, not the Compact version, and I won’t have any additional sidebar on the right. If you don’t see the full Ribbon, click on the small arrow in the top right corner of the Outlook window and select Classic Ribbon and "Always Show Ribbon." This ensures that all commands remain visible instead of being collapsed into a simplified menu. 
Now you might wonder what the Ribbon actually is and what other parts there are in Outlook. When you open it, you’ll see a few key default areas. On the very left, there is the navigation bar which lets you quickly jump between different applications. Next to it, there’s the Folder Pane, where all your email folders are located. In the center, you have your Inbox, which lists your emails. To the right, there’s the Reading Pane, where you can preview emails without opening them in a separate window. 

Let’s start by setting up the inbox layout so you can scan emails quickly and focus on what matters. Select your inbox and click on the View tab at the top, then select Change View. You’ll see different options based on your Email account: 
If you have a Microsoft Exchange account you’ll see three different options:
Compact View is the default and displays emails with two preview lines beneath each subject. This works well if you want a balance between detail and readability. 
Single View is the most condensed option, showing emails as a simple list without preview lines. This is great for smaller screens or if you prefer to see more emails at once. If you use this view and want to adjust the number of columns shown, go to View Settings > Columns and remove any unnecessary ones to keep things clean. 

Finally, there is Preview View expands the message preview, showing more text from each email in the list but no reading pane in the default view. Let me show you how you can add the reading pane in just a bit. But the preview view is helpful if you prefer to skim through emails without opening them.
The best choice really depends on your screen size and personal preference. On my 13-inch laptop, I use Single View to maximize space and have reduced the number of columns to avoid clutter. On my desktop with an external monitor, I use Compact View because there’s more room to display additional details without making the inbox feel cramped.

If you don’t have a Microsoft Exchange account but integrated an IMAP account in Outlook, for example a Gmail address, you’ll see different message view filters when clicking on Change View.
Selecting the first one, IMAP Messages, gives you the same view as the Single View for an Exchange account. Choosing the right-most option, Preview, corresponds to the Preview View used with Exchange accounts.
The other two options, Hide Messages and Group Messages, are marked to be removed in future versions of Outlook.

Now let’s set up the Reading Pane so you can preview emails without opening each one individually. Click on the View tab, then select Reading Pane. You can choose to place it on the right or at the bottom, or turn it off. The right-side placement is the most commonly used setup and works well for standard or widescreen monitors because it gives you more space to read emails. The bottom placement is better for smaller screens because it leaves more room for your email list.

Now, as you skim through your emails, you’ll notice that Outlook automatically marks them as read as soon as you click on them. If you prefer to have more control over this, you can adjust the settings to prevent emails from being marked as read too quickly.
Go to the View tab, click Reading Pane, and select Options. By default, Outlook waits five seconds before marking an email as read, but you can increase or decrease this delay based on your preference. If you often scan through emails quickly and don’t want them marked as read until you take action, increasing the delay—or disabling automatic read status altogether—can help you keep track of messages that still need your attention.

Next, let’s adjust the Folder Pane, which helps you quickly access different mail folders. If it feels too cluttered or is hidden, you can resize it by dragging the edge to make it wider or narrower. If it’s missing, click on the View tab, select Folder Pane, and choose Normal to keep it visible. You can also collapse or minimize and expand it using the small arrow. If you expand it and want it to stay open, click the pin icon so it remains fixed in place. On my desktop, I prefer to have the Folder Pane fully expanded for easy access to all my folders. But when I’m working on my laptop, I usually shrink it down to the bare minimum to save screen space.

Finally, let’s look at the To-Do Bar. This is useful if you want to keep track of your tasks and calendar without switching windows. If it’s not visible, go to the View tab, select To-Do Bar, and choose to display Tasks, Calendar, or People. I personally like having the calendar and tasks open at all times so I can see my upcoming appointments and action items at a glance, even while working in my inbox.

Let’s quickly recap what we’ve adjusted so we’re all working with the same interface for the rest of the module. We’ve set the Classic Ribbon to always be visible, kept the Folder Pane in Normal view, organized emails in Compact View, placed the Reading Pane on the right, and enabled the Calendar at the top with Tasks at the bottom of the right-hand sidebar.
Now that the main features of your Outlook interface are optimized, you have a clean and efficient layout that makes it easier to navigate your emails and stay organized. This setup will serve as the foundation for everything else we’ll cover in this module.
