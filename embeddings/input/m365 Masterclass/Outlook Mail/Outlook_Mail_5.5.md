# Work Faster: Set Up Quick Steps for 1-Click Email Tasks
Having already taken a few steps to automate your inbox, let’s further speed up your workflow with Quick Steps, one of Outlook’s most underrated time-saving features. If you find yourself repeating the same email tasks over and over—like moving emails to folders, forwarding messages, or applying categories—Quick Steps lets you do it all with a single click. Instead of manually going through multiple steps, you can automate frequent actions and save time with just one button.

To set up a Quick Step, go to the Home tab in Outlook and look for the Quick Steps section in the ribbon. Click Create New to set up a custom action. Give it a name that makes sense, like Move to Project Folder, then choose what it should do. You can select multiple actions, such as moving an email to a specific folder, marking it as read, and applying a category—all in one click. 
For example, if you frequently receive client update emails and always move them to a dedicated folder, you can automate the process with a Quick Step. Unlike rules, which work best when emails follow a clear pattern (like a specific sender or subject line), Quick Steps give you more flexibility—you trigger the action manually with one click, which is ideal when messages vary but the next step is always the same.

To setup a Quick Step, click Create New, name it Move to Client Updates, then select Move to Folder and choose the correct folder. If you also want these emails marked as read when moved, add that as a second action. Click Finish, and now, whenever a client email arrives, simply click the Quick Step, and Outlook will handle everything instantly—no dragging, no extra steps.

The best part is that Quick Steps offer endless possibilities, allowing you to automate almost any sequence of email actions. Since we can’t cover every combination, I recommend identifying the tasks you repeat most often in your daily workflow and seeing how you can streamline them with Quick Steps. Once you start using them, you’ll be surprised how much time you save.
Personally, I use Quick Steps for filing emails, flagging important messages, and sending pre-written responses. For example, when I get a travel-related email, I hit my Move to Travel Quick Step, and it’s instantly categorized, marked as unread and moved to the right folder—no dragging, no extra steps.
Once you get into the habit of using Quick Steps, you’ll notice how much faster and smoother email management becomes. Now let’s take it even further with some more tips to streamline your inbox management.
