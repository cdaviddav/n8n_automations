# Keep Emails Forever: Automate Backup & Retention
Next up, let’s talk about how to automatically back up and retain important emails in Outlook—especially useful if you want to archive key communication, stay compliant, or simply avoid losing something critical. Whether you need to keep project-related emails, client correspondence, or personal records, Outlook gives you a few ways to make sure your emails don’t disappear over time.

First, it’s important to know that if you’re using a Microsoft 365 business or enterprise account, your organization may already manage retention policies centrally. That means your IT department might automatically archive or delete emails after a set period. You can check your retention settings by right-clicking a folder like your inbox, clicking Properties, and checking the Policy tab. If it’s greyed out, then it’s managed by your admin.

If you're on a personal or family Microsoft 365 account, or if your organization gives you permission to manage retention yourself, you can use AutoArchive. To check if it's enabled, go to File > Options > Advanced, then scroll to the AutoArchive section. Click AutoArchive Settings. Here, you can choose how often Outlook should archive old emails, where to move them, and whether to permanently delete anything.

You can also set folder-level rules. Right-click on any folder, choose Properties, then go to the AutoArchive tab. From here, you can override the global settings and keep emails in that specific folder for as long as you like—or choose to never archive them at all.

I have to say, I don’t rely much on AutoArchive in my personal setup. For my professional work, backups and retention are handled by my organization, so everything is managed in the background without me needing to worry about it. Personally, I’ve mostly kept Outlook’s default settings because they’ve worked well for me—I don’t have any of my folders set to auto-archive, and so far, that’s been just fine. But your setup might be different. If you deal with a high volume of important emails daily, or if you prefer to keep a tidy mailbox without deleting anything, it might be worth turning on AutoArchive and customizing it to fit your needs.
