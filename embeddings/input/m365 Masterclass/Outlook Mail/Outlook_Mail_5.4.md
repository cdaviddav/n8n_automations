# Stay on Track: Link Emails and Tasks with ToDo & Planner
Now let’s go over one more key email management tip—linking your emails to tasks—so nothing falls through the cracks and you always stay on top of what needs to be done.
Emails often contain important action items, but if you leave them sitting in your inbox, they can quickly get lost among other messages. Instead of relying on memory or flagging emails and hoping you’ll remember them later, Outlook allows you to link emails directly to your task list, making it easy to track and follow up on them.

In an earlier video, we covered how to flag emails so they appear in the To-Do Bar on the right. Now, let’s take it a step further and ensure these tasks sync seamlessly with Microsoft To Do and Planner, so you can access and manage them across all your devices and tools.

To keep track of important emails, you have two options: flagging the email or dragging it into Microsoft To Do from the Outlook navigation bar. As we have already covered the process of simply flagging them, let’s also discuss a more visual approach. Simply drag the email from your inbox into the To Do icon in the left-hand navigation bar. This automatically creates a task with the email attached, so you can access it later without searching through your inbox.
Now, let’s look at where this flagged email appears across Outlook, Microsoft To Do, and Planner.
In Outlook’s To-Do Bar, the flagged email automatically shows up in the Tasks list on the right side of your inbox. From here, you can sort tasks by due date, mark them as complete, or open the original email with one click.

In Microsoft To Do, flagged emails automatically appear in the Flagged Email list. Open To Do, and on the left panel, you'll find this list, which collects all emails you've flagged in Outlook. You can adjust due dates, add reminders, or include notes directly within To Do. In addition to the Flagged Email list, your flagged email will also appear in the Planned list or My Day, depending on its due date.
In Microsoft Planner, you'll see your flagged emails them under My Tasks or My Day, again depending on the due date. In My Tasks, make sure to select the right filter—either All, , or Flagged Emails—to see them.

When using Outlook, To Do, and Planner, not all updates sync perfectly across the apps. Shared attributes, like due dates, sync reliably across all three—whether updated in Outlook, To Do, or Planner—though it may take a few seconds or minutes to fully reflect. For flagged emails in Outlook, the email content appears as a text field in To Do and the whole email is attached to the task in Planner.
Attributes unique to specific apps, like priority and progress in Planner and To Do, or reminders in To Do, don’t sync to the others. Notes sync differently based on task type: for original Outlook tasks (not flagged emails), notes sync across all three apps via the task’s content text field. For flagged emails, notes added in Planner or To Do sync only between those two, as the email content in Outlook can’t be modified.
Understanding the distinction between original Outlook tasks and flagged emails helps clarify how updates sync, making this setup powerful once you know each tool’s strengths and limitations.
