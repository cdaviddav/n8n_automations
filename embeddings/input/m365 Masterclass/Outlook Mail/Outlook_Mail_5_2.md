# Simplify Your Inbox: Create Rules for Auto-Sorting Emails
Next up, let’s take inbox organization to the next level by automating email sorting with rules. Manually moving emails into folders works, but if you receive dozens—or even hundreds—of emails daily, it quickly becomes a chore. Instead of sorting emails yourself, Outlook can do it for you automatically.

Email rules help you filter, categorize, and organize messages the moment they arrive, reducing clutter and saving time. Whether you want client emails to go straight to a project folder, newsletters to skip the inbox, or meeting invites to stand out, rules let you automate the process.

Let’s create a rule to automatically move emails from a specific sender. Find an email from that sender, right-click it, and select Rules > Create Rule. A window will appear where you can choose conditions. Check the box next to the sender’s name and select Move the item to folder. Pick the folder where you want those emails to go, then click OK. From now on, all emails from that sender will be filed automatically. 

If you need more control, go to the Rules Wizard for advanced options. Click File > Manage Rules & Alerts, then New Rule. Here, you can set rules based on keywords, subjects, attachments, or even whether you're in the CC field. For example, if you want newsletters to skip your inbox, create a rule that moves emails containing "Unsubscribe" to a "Newsletters" folder.

Personally, I use rules to file messages from my company’s HR system, sort specific client emails or newsletter and keep my inbox focused. This way, I can prioritize important tasks without constantly sorting through emails.

Once your rules are in place, Outlook takes care of sorting emails automatically, keeping your inbox organized with minimal effort. Now that you've streamlined the clutter, the next step is prioritizing what remains—which we’ll cover in the next video.
