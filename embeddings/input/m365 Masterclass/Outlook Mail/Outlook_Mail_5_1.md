# Organize with Ease: Build Folder Structures for Work, Projects & More
Let’s start by bringing structure to your inbox with a folder system that makes sorting emails effortless and finding important messages quick and easy. The key is to create a setup that matches how you work, so you always know where to find what you need.
Now, some people prefer not to use folders at all, keeping everything in their inbox and relying on search instead. This can work if you have a strong habit of using search operators and filters effectively. If that’s your approach, you might not need an extensive folder structure but will find the next chapter insightful, where I’ll cover search extensively. 
But search alone isn’t always enough. Without organization, your inbox can quickly become cluttered, making it harder to find important emails. This is especially frustrating when messages are poorly labeled, or you can’t recall the exact content or sender, forcing you to sift through unrelated emails manually.

On the other hand, a structured folder system makes it easier to group related emails together, reducing the need for constant searching. It’s especially useful if you manage multiple projects, teams, or ongoing conversations that you frequently revisit.
If you prefer the folder method, let’s set up a system that works for you. In Outlook, right-click on your inbox and select New Folder. Name it based on your workflow. If you manage multiple projects, you might create a top-level folder for each project, with subfolders for key categories like Client Emails, Internal Updates, and Action Items. If you organize emails by task status, consider folders like To Do, Waiting for Response, and Reference to track what still needs attention.

Once your folders are set up, you might want to reorganize and sort them for easier navigation. By default, Outlook keeps folders in the order they were created, but you can manually move them by dragging and dropping them into a new position. If you prefer an alphabetical order, right-click on your account name in the folder pane, select Sort Subfolders A to Z, and Outlook will instantly arrange them for you.
If you need to nest folders inside each other, simply drag one folder onto another. This is useful for grouping related folders under a single category, like placing "Invoices" and "Contracts" under a main "Finance" folder. If you ever need to move a folder back to the main list, just drag it out again.
For quick access to frequently used folders, you can also pin them to Favorites. Right-click a folder and select Add to Favorites, and it will appear at the top of your folder list for easy access.
The simplest way to move emails in your folders is by drag and drop. Alternatively, right-click an email, select Move, and choose the appropriate folder. If you frequently move emails to the same place, Outlook will suggest recent folders, saving you even more time.

I like to keep things simple by starting with broad top-level folders and only a few essential subfolders. As my needs evolve, I add new folders when necessary but avoid overcomplicating the structure to keep everything easy to manage.
Once you’ve built a folder system that fits your workflow, the next step is automating the process so Outlook does the organizing for you. In the next video, we’ll set up rules to sort emails automatically so you can keep your inbox structured with minimal effort.
