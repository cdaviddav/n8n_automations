# Turn Emails into Actions: Drag Emails to Calendar & OneNote
In this video, let’s look at a quick way to turn emails into action items by dragging them directly into your Calendar, OneNote, or Microsoft Loop. Instead of manually copying information or rewriting details, you can instantly convert an email into a task, note, or meeting with just a simple drag-and-drop—helping you stay organized without extra effort.

If you want to turn an email into a calendar event, simply drag it onto the Calendar icon in the Navigation Bar. This automatically creates a new appointment, using the email subject as the event title and copying the email body into the details section. You can then adjust the date and time, add attendees if needed, and convert it into a Teams meeting by clicking the Teams Meeting button. Once everything is set, click Send to schedule it.
I use this feature all the time—whether for time-blocking personal tasks, scheduling reminders, or quickly turning emails that contain meeting requests, deadlines, or follow-ups into actual calendar events.

To save an email directly into OneNote, you need to have OneNote open and drag the email into your desired notebook. Unlike with Calendar, dragging the email onto the OneNote icon in the Navigation Bar does not work.
Once you drag the email into OneNote, you’ll be asked whether you want to attach the email as a file or insert a printout. If you choose to attach a file, an Outlook .msg file will be embedded in the OneNote page, which you can open later. If you select insert as a printout, the entire email will be captured as an image, meaning you won’t be able to edit or annotate within the text.
If you want the email content to remain editable, there’s a better way. Instead of dragging, go to the Message tab in Outlook, click Move, and select Send to OneNote. Choose the notebook and section where you want to store it, and the email will appear in OneNote as fully editable text—allowing you to add notes, highlights, or annotations.

Now let’s talk about Microsoft Loop. At the moment, there isn’t a direct “send to Loop” feature in Outlook. But you can still copy the relevant part of the email and paste it into a Loop component or Loop page. It’s great for collaborative work, especially if you’re collecting ideas, assigning tasks, or organizing information with your team in real time. Once in Loop, everyone can add comments, edit content, and keep everything up to date across Microsoft 365.
