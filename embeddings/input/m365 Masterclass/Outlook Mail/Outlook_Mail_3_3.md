# Save Time: Master Email Templates & Quick Parts for Consistency
Writing the same type of email over and over again is a huge time-waster. Whether it’s responding to common inquiries, sending meeting follow-ups, or sharing project updates, typing out the same message every time is inefficient. Not only does it slow you down, but it also increases the risk of inconsistencies or small errors slipping in.

The good news is that Outlook has built-in tools to help—Email Templates and Quick Parts. These features allow you to create reusable content that you can insert into emails with just a few clicks. Once you set them up, you’ll never have to type the same response from scratch again.

Let’s start with Email Templates, which are great for full emails you send repeatedly. To create one, open a new email and type out the message exactly how you want it. If there are placeholders like names, dates, or custom details, leave them blank so you can fill them in later. Once your email is ready, click File, then Save As, and choose Outlook Template (.oft) from the dropdown menu. Give it a clear name and save it in the default location. 
To use a template, go to the New Items menu in Outlook, go to More Items, and select Choose Form. In the Look In dropdown, select User Templates in File System, and you’ll see your saved templates. Select the one you need, make any quick edits, and hit send. If you frequently use templates, consider pinning the template folder or saving shortcuts for even faster access. 
If you prefer to save your template somewhere other than the default location, simply choose a different folder when saving it and click Save. This makes accessing it even faster. Instead of navigating through Outlook menus, you can just double-click the file from your chosen folder, and it will open as a new email, ready to customize and send.

Now let’s talk about Quick Parts, which are perfect for reusable chunks of text—like a closing paragraph, a standard introduction, or instructions you send often. Instead of copying and pasting from old emails, you can save these snippets inside Outlook and insert them instantly.

To create a Quick Part, type out the text you want to save in an email. Highlight it, then go to the Insert tab and click Quick Parts, then Save Selection to Quick Part Gallery. Give it a name that makes sense, then click OK.

Next time you need to use it, open an email, place your cursor where you want the text to appear, go to Insert > Quick Parts, and select the saved entry. Outlook will drop it in automatically. If you use Quick Parts regularly, you can type the first few letters of the saved entry’s name, press F3, and Outlook will insert the full text instantly.

Now you might wonder where the difference is between Templates and Quick Parts. Templates save entire emails, including the subject line, body, and formatting, making them perfect for frequently sent full messages. Quick Parts, on the other hand, store reusable text snippets, allowing you to quickly insert common phrases, instructions, or disclaimers into any email. Use Templates for full emails and Quick Parts for frequently used sections of text.

Next to Templates and Quick Parts, there’s one more little trick worth knowing: you can also use email signatures as an alternative or maybe even shortcut for templates. While most people think of signatures just for contact info, they can actually be used to save full blocks of text—like intro messages, disclaimers, or standard responses.
To set one up, go to File > Options > Mail > Signatures and create a new signature. Give it a name that helps you remember what it’s for (e.g. “Project Update” or “Follow-up”). Then paste your message into the signature editor—Outlook will save the formatting too.

When writing an email, just go to Insert > Signature and pick the entry you want to use. The text will instantly drop into your email, and you can edit it before sending. It’s a handy workaround when you don’t want to deal with templates or Quick Parts. Just keep in mind that, unlike templates, signatures don’t include a subject line and don’t require the “Choose Form” menu—making them faster to access and perfect for quickly inserting standard content on the fly.
