# Find Anything Fast: Master Outlook’s Search Bar Tools
In this video, let’s focus on finding emails quickly and efficiently. Scrolling through your inbox or manually looking through folders wastes valuable time, especially when you're searching for an old email buried among hundreds of others. Instead of digging through endless messages, Outlook’s Search Bar Tools help you locate exactly what you need—fast.

At the top of Outlook, you’ll see the Search Bar. Click inside, and Outlook automatically suggests recent searches or common filters. But instead of just typing a keyword and hoping for the best, you can use advanced search tools to refine your results.

Let’s start with basic filters. When you click onto the small arrow on the right of the Search Bar, Outlook provides quick options like From, Subject, Has Attachments, Date Received, and many more. If you’re looking for an email from a specific person, type their name or email address in the From field or use From colon Name to instantly filter results. For example, typing From colon John Doe will only show emails from that sender.

Now, let’s say you’re searching for an email with an attachment but don’t remember the sender. Select yes in the Has Attachments filter, and Outlook will only display emails that include a file. If you need something from a specific timeframe, click Received and select a date range like Last Week, Last Month, or This Year to narrow down your results.

For even more precision, use search operators. If you remember part of an email’s subject, type Subject colon meeting to find all emails with “meeting” in the subject line. If you need to locate an email that contains a specific word, but you’re unsure where it appears, use Body colon report to find all messages mentioning “report” in the email content. Alternatively, you can always use the filters instead of the search prompts. 
In addition to using search filters, you can narrow down your search by selecting specific mailboxes. Click the dropdown menu to the left of the search bar and choose where to search—whether it's your current folder, entire inbox, specific mailboxes, or even all Outlook items. This helps you focus on the most relevant emails and avoid unnecessary results.

If you need even more filtering options, click "Add More Options" at the bottom left of the search window. Here, you can select additional fields to refine your search or reset the default search settings. This allows you to be as specific as needed, making it easier to locate even the most buried emails.

Personally, I rely on Outlook’s search function all the time. Most of the time, simply searching for a name, attachment, or a keyword in the email body is enough for me. I also tend to remember details well, so I don’t always need too many filters—but when I do, these advanced options come in handy.
If you haven’t started using Outlook’s Search Bar Tools, I highly recommend giving them a try. They’ll save you a ton of time. Speaking of time-saving tips, the next one will do just that—so let’s move on.
