# Speak Your Emails: Use Dictation with Auto-Punctuation
Now let’s move on and look at how dictation in Outlook can help you write emails faster and with less effort—all without touching the keyboard. Whether you want to save time, reduce typing fatigue, or get your thoughts down quickly, Outlook’s built-in dictation tool lets you speak your emails naturally while automatically handling punctuation.

To use Dictation, first make sure your microphone is connected and turned on. Then open a new email, click into the message body, and go to the Message tab. Click Dictate, and a microphone icon will appear—click it to start speaking. Outlook will transcribe your words in real time and automatically insert punctuation as you go. You can also speak formatting commands like “new paragraph”, “comma”, or “period” to fine-tune the structure while you talk.
If you need to correct something, simply pause and edit using the keyboard or voice commands. You can also change the dictation language by clicking the Settings gear next to the microphone icon and selecting your preferred language.

Even though I don’t use dictation regularly, I think it’s a really useful feature to have. A colleague of mine once injured his index finger and couldn’t type properly for a few weeks. During that time, he relied almost entirely on Outlook’s dictation feature—and surprisingly, he was nearly as fast and productive as before. It’s a great backup when typing isn’t an option or when you just want to get thoughts down quickly.
