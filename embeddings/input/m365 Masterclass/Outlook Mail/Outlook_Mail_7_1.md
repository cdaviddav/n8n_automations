# Focus on What Matters: Use Focused Inbox Effectively
In this video, let’s tackle email overload by using Focused Inbox to separate important messages from distractions. If your inbox is constantly flooded with newsletters, automated alerts, and non-urgent emails, it’s easy to miss critical messages. Instead of sorting through everything manually, Focused Inbox automatically prioritizes the emails that matter most—so you can work smarter, not harder.
To enable Focused Inbox, go to the View tab in Outlook and click Show Focused Inbox. Once activated, your inbox will be split into two tabs: Focused and Other. Outlook will automatically determine which emails belong in Focused based on your interactions—messages from people you frequently email will appear there, while promotional emails and low-priority messages are filtered into Other.
If an important email lands in the wrong tab, you can move it manually. Right-click the email, select Move to Focused Inbox, and choose Always Move if you want future emails from that sender to appear in Focused. The same works in reverse—if something irrelevant ends up in Focused, move it to Other to train Outlook’s filtering system.

If you prefer not to use Focused Inbox, you can simply leave it disabled and stick with the classic All vs. Unread view.
Personally, I don’t rely on Focused Inbox because I’ve had important emails mistakenly placed in the Other tab, causing me to overlook them. After that, I switched back to All vs. Unread, which gives me full control over what I see and ensures I don’t miss anything critical.
That said, Focused Inbox might work well for you, especially if your inbox is overloaded with low-priority messages. It’s worth trying to see if it helps streamline your workflow.
