# Stay Professional: Set Up Auto-Replies When Away
In this video, let’s look at how to set up automatic replies in Outlook to maintain clear communication even when you're out of the office. Whether you’re on vacation, in a workshop, or simply offline for a day, a well-crafted auto-reply ensures that people aren’t left waiting or wondering if their message got through.

To set this up, go to File in Outlook, then click on Automatic Replies. In the pop-up window, select Send automatic replies and set your time range—this tells Outlook when to turn the message on and off. If you don’t set a timeframe, you’ll need to remember to manually turn it off when you return.
You’ll see two message fields: one for internal senders, and one for external contacts. Use the internal message to update your colleagues with helpful details—like when you’ll be back and who to contact in your absence. For the external message, I’d suggest keeping it short and professional. You might want to avoid sharing too much detail and just provide a general response or an alternative contact.

You might notice that you only see one message box and no separate option for internal and external senders. That usually happens if you're using a non-Microsoft 365 or IMAP account—these account types don’t support the advanced server-side rules that enable separate messages. In that case, you can still set a general auto-reply, but it will go to everyone who emails you.
When I’m out of the office, I usually keep it simple and send the same auto-reply to both internal and external contacts. It saves time, and I only have to write one message. That said, I’ve seen all kinds of approaches among colleagues—some include details like the reason for their absence (vacation, training, client visit), while others just keep it generic. If you prefer to tailor your message based on the situation, it’s helpful to keep a few templates saved in OneNote or Loop so you can quickly copy and paste the right one when needed.

If you're using Outlook with a Microsoft 365 account, you can also click Rules in the bottom-left corner of the Automatic Replies window to set up additional automations while you're away. For example, you might want to forward all messages from a specific client to a colleague covering for you. Just add their address in the "From" field and choose the actions you want Outlook to apply automatically. It’s a small setup that can make a big difference in keeping work flowing while you're offline.
