# Boost Credibility: Set Up & Manage Email Signatures with Ease
Your email signature might seem like a small detail, but it plays a big role in how professional and credible you appear. A good signature makes it easy for recipients to know who you are, how to contact you, and where to find more information about your work. I have seen many professionals either don’t have a signature at all or use one that’s cluttered, inconsistent, or missing key details.

So let me help you set up and manage your email signature to ensure it looks polished and includes the right information.
First, open Outlook and go to File, then select Options. In the Mail section, look for the Signatures button right next to “Create or modify signature or messages” and click on it. This is where you can create, edit, and manage multiple signatures. Click New, give your signature a name, and start typing your details in the text box.

If your company provides a default signature, you’ll likely need to use that. But if you’re creating your own, keep it simple, clear, and professional. A standard signature typically includes your name, job title, company name, and contact details. If relevant, you can add a link to your website or LinkedIn profile, but avoid clutter—too many details, social media links, or quotes can make it look messy.
Stick to a standard font like Calibri, Arial, or Verdana for readability. You can bold your name or slightly increase the font size to make it stand out. If you include a website or email address, make sure they are clickable using the Insert Link button, symbolized by a globe and the chain symbol.
If you want to include a logo, you can upload one by clicking the Image icon in the signature editor. Keep it small and test it by sending yourself an email to ensure it displays correctly across different devices.

Now, let’s make sure your signature is applied automatically. Below the editor, you’ll see two dropdown menus: one for New Messages and one for Replies and Forwards. If you want your signature to appear in every email, select it in both menus. If you prefer a shorter signature in replies, you can create a separate version and apply it just to forwarded messages and replies. Once everything is set, click OK, and your new signature is ready to go.
Personally, I use two versions of my signature: a longer one for new messages and external communication, and a shorter version for internal emails and forwarded messages. The long version includes all key details, while the short version keeps it minimal to avoid unnecessary clutter in ongoing conversations.

If you ever need to update your signature, you can come back to the same menu and make changes anytime. Taking a few minutes to set up a professional signature ensures that every email you send reinforces your credibility and makes it easy for people to connect with you.
