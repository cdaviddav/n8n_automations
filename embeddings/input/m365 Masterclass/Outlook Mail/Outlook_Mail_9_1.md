# Get Noticed: Use @Mentions for Team Emails
Let’s look at how @Mentions in Outlook can help you write clearer team emails and make sure the right people don’t miss key information. Especially in long threads or when multiple people are involved, it’s easy for tasks or action items to get overlooked—but @Mentions help cut through the noise and bring clarity.
To use @Mentions, open a new email or reply, and when typing your message, simply type the @ symbol followed by the person’s name—for example, “@Jordan.” Outlook will suggest matching names from your address book or recently used contacts. Once selected, that person will not only be highlighted in the email body, but also automatically added to the To field if they weren’t already.

You can use this to assign tasks or direct attention, like writing “@Amanda, can you please follow up with the client by Thursday?” This makes it easy for the recipient to scan for their name and see exactly what they need to do. Plus, if they use Outlook rules or filtering, they can set their inbox to flag emails where they’re mentioned, which helps them prioritize better.
I find @Mentions especially helpful when I’m looping someone into a conversation mid-thread or when I’m emailing a group but want to clearly assign responsibility without writing a separate message. It’s a small thing that makes a big difference in clarity and accountability.
