# Fix Errors Fast: Recall & Replace Sent Emails
Next up, let’s look at a feature that can save you when you’ve hit Send too soon—recalling or replacing a sent email. Maybe you forgot an attachment, made a mistake in the content, or realized you sent it to the wrong person. It happens to all of us. Fortunately, Outlook gives you the option to pull that email back—at least under the right conditions.

To recall a message, go to your Sent Items, open the email you want to recall, and in the ribbon under the Message tab, click on Actions, then choose Recall This Message. You’ll see two options: one to delete unread copies of the email, and another to delete unread copies and replace it with a new one. Choose the one that fits best, then hit OK.
Now, a couple of important things to keep in mind. First, this feature only works if both you and the recipient are using Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft 365 within the same organization. Also, if the email has already been opened or the recipient is outside your organization, recall won’t work. In that case, you may want to follow up with a correction email.

If you choose to replace the message, Outlook will automatically open a new draft so you can make your changes and resend it. I recommend acting quickly—recall is most effective when the message hasn’t been read yet.
Personally, I don’t rely on the recall feature too much, simply because it only works under very specific conditions and often isn’t successful. Instead, I’ve set up a one-minute delay for all outgoing emails, as we covered earlier. That short buffer gives me just enough time to spot a mistake, make a quick correction, or stop the email entirely—without having to depend on recall. It’s a simple tweak, but one that’s saved me more than once.
