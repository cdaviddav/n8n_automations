# Speed Up Decisions: Collect Team Votes Easily
In this video, let’s look at how to speed up decision-making by using Outlook’s built-in voting feature—perfect for getting quick input from many different people without long email threads. Whether you’re choosing between two options, confirming attendance, or making a simple team decision, Outlook lets you collect responses in a structured way, right inside your email.
To set up a voting email, open a new message, go to the Options tab, and click on Use Voting Buttons. You’ll see default options like Approve/Reject or Yes/No, but you can also click Custom to create your own response choices. Just separate each voting option with a semicolon—for example, “Option A; Option B; Option C.”

Write your message as usual, letting your recipients know what you're asking them to vote on. Once you send the email, everyone will see the voting buttons at the top of the message. They can choose their response with a single click, and Outlook will track the responses automatically.
To view the results, go to your Sent Items, open the original message, and click Tracking in the Message tab. You’ll see a list of who voted and what their responses were—no need to copy-paste answers into Excel or follow up with individual emails.

Now, if you're using Microsoft 365 and your account is connected to Exchange, there's another option: creating a poll using Microsoft Forms. To be honest, I like this option even more so because it provides a richer and more convenient and modern experience. 

When you open a new email in Outlook, look for the Poll icon in the toolbar—it’s usually under the Insert tab, on the left side in the Include section. The icon looks like a small horizontal bar chart. If you don’t see it there, try switching to the Message tab and clicking on All Apps. From there, select Polls.
Outlook will then either open a poll pane on the right side of your screen or directly embed a poll component into your message. You can type your question, add multiple-choice options, and customize the settings. Behind the scenes, this creates a Microsoft Form that powers your poll.

If you're using the latest version of Outlook and your Microsoft 365 account has Loop components enabled—which is typically the case for business users—you might see the poll appear as an interactive Loop component. This version lets you tweak settings like whether respondent names are recorded or whether results are visible to everyone. The poll will be embedded directly into your email and can also be shared via a direct link.
In other cases, where the poll is created in the side pane, you'll finalize the poll and then click Add to email. This inserts a clickable link to the poll into your message.
Functionally, both versions work the same way—with a slightly different look and feel. When your recipients get the email, they can vote directly in the message or click to open the full form in their browser. You (and, if allowed, the respondents) can then track the results in real time via the Microsoft Forms link.

In my organization, we’ve used the Poll feature quite a bit—for example, when our team assistant asked whether we’d be bringing a plus-one to the team dinner. It’s a simple and effective way to make informed decisions without back-and-forth. Everyone can just respond with one click, using tools they’re already familiar with.
