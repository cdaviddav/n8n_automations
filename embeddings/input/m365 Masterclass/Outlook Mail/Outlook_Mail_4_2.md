# Control Your Inbox: Customize Previews & Organize Threads for Clarity
Now that you know how to quickly find emails using filters and views, let’s take it a step further and refine how your inbox is organized for even better control.
A cluttered inbox makes it harder to find important emails and track conversations. By customizing message previews and organizing threads, you can scan your inbox faster and keep discussions neatly grouped.
Let’s start with adjusting the message preview settings. By default, Outlook displays a two-line preview under each email’s subject, but you can change this to show more or less text based on your preference. If you want a cleaner view with more emails visible at once, you can reduce it to a one-line preview, which is similar to the single view we have covered in the second chapter about Outlooks interface. 
If you prefer to see more content before opening a message, you can expand it to three lines. To change this, go to the View tab, click Message Preview, and select off to see no preview, 1 Line, 2 Lines, or 3 Lines. Personally, I use one-line preview when working on my laptop to see more emails at a glance but have two-line preview on my desktop computer with external monitor, where I have more space.

To see more emails at a glance, you can enable “Use tighter spacing” in the View tab for a more compact layout.
Now, let’s make sure emails that go back and forth multiple times are grouped together in a conversation view. When a long thread appears as separate emails, it’s easy to lose track of the latest reply or the information that was shared in an earlier email of the conversation. To fix this, go to the View tab and check the Show as Conversations box. Outlook will now group all emails in a thread into a single expandable message, making it much easier to follow discussions without endless scrolling. 
If you want more control over how conversations are displayed, click Conversation Settings in the same menu. Here, you can enable Always Expand Conversations if you prefer to see all replies immediately. You can also turn on Show Messages from Other Folders, which is useful if replies to a thread are stored in different folders, like Sent Items.

If Outlook’s default font size feels too small or hard to read, it’s easy to adjust for better visibility and a more comfortable experience. In the View tab, click View Settings, then Other Settings, and increase the Row Font Size by clicking on the button. This won’t change the email content itself but will make the subject lines and sender names easier to read, which is especially useful on high-resolution screens.
With these settings, your inbox will be clearer and easier to navigate—next, you’ll learn how to automate your email management with just a few simple tips and tricks.
