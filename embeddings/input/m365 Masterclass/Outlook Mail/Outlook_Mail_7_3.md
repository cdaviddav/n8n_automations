# Clean Up Fast: Master Auto-Tools for a Lean Inbox
In this video, let’s look at Outlook’s built-in cleanup tools that help you clear email clutter quickly without manually deleting messages one by one. If your inbox is filled with redundant emails—like long conversation threads where the latest message contains the entire history—there’s no need to keep every individual reply. Instead of sorting through them manually, Outlook can automate the cleanup for you, keeping only what’s necessary.

One of the easiest ways to reduce inbox clutter is by using the Clean Up tool. To try it out, select a conversation or folder, go to the Home tab, and click Clean Up. You’ll see three options: Clean Up Conversation, Clean Up Folder, and Clean Up Folder & Subfolders.

Clean Up Conversation removes redundant messages in a single email thread, keeping only the latest email that contains the full conversation history. This is perfect for long discussions where everyone keeps replying with the same content quoted.

Clean Up Folder works the same way but applies to an entire folder at once, eliminating duplicate messages while keeping the most recent versions. If you want to apply this across multiple folders, use Clean Up Folder & Subfolders to instantly reduce clutter across multiple sections of your inbox.

If you’re worried about losing something important, don’t worry—Outlook doesn’t delete emails immediately. Instead, they’re moved to the Deleted Items folder, where you can review them before permanently removing anything.

Another way to keep your inbox clean automatically is by setting up AutoArchive. Go to File > Options > Advanced, then click AutoArchive Settings. Here, you can define how often old emails should be moved to an archive folder instead of cluttering your inbox. This is especially useful if you want to keep a record of emails but don’t need them in your active inbox.

Keep in mind that if you're using a corporate account, AutoArchive may be disabled since many organizations manage backup and archiving settings centrally. This feature is typically only available in personal or family Microsoft 365 accounts.
