# Gather Key Emails: Set Up Smart Search Folders
In this video, let’s take email search and organization to the next level by setting up Smart Search Folders. If you frequently search for the same types of emails—like important client messages, flagged tasks, or emails from a specific person—manually running a search every time isn’t efficient. Instead of constantly filtering through your inbox, you can create Smart Search Folders that automatically gather emails based on your criteria—so you always have key messages in one place.

A Search Folder isn’t a physical folder but rather a dynamic view of emails that match specific conditions. It continuously updates as new emails arrive, saving you from having to search manually.
To create a Smart Search Folder, go to the Folder tab and click on the little popup that appears when hovering over Search Folder. Click New Search Folder and a pop-up window will appear with different preset options. You can choose from categories like Unread Mail, Mail Flagged for Follow-Up, or Mail from Specific People. If none of these presets fit your needs, scroll down and select Create a Custom Search Folder, then click Choose to define your own filters.
Let’s go through an example. Say you frequently receive emails with important attachments—contracts, reports, or reference files—but don’t always remember who sent them. Instead of searching manually, you can create a Search Folder that gathers all emails with attachments in one place.

To set this up, select Mail with Attachments from the New Search Folder window and click OK. Outlook will instantly create a folder that displays every email containing an attachment, updating automatically as new ones arrive. If you want to refine the folder even further, right click on the folder and select Customize Search Folder and Criteria, then add filters like date range, specific keywords in the subject line, or emails from certain senders. Keep in mind that you can only customize or change the criteria of a Search Folder once it contains emails. If the folder is empty, the customization options won’t be available.

I used to find myself repeatedly searching for the same type of email—one with a specific attachment that was regularly updated by the same sender. After realizing how often I was running the same search, I finally created a Search Folder for it. Since then, anytime I notice a recurring search, I save it as a Search Folder, making it effortless to retrieve important emails without typing the same query over and over.
I’m sure you’ll experience the same thing—once you start using Search Folders, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without them.
