# Stay Focused: Set Up Smart Notifications
Another great feature I’d like to cover next, helps you taking control of email notifications so they help you stay on top of important messages without constantly interrupting your workflow. If you get a notification for every single email, it’s easy to get distracted—pulling your focus away from meaningful work. Instead of letting Outlook dictate your attention, you can customize notifications to alert you only when it really matters.

To adjust your notifications, go to File > Options > Mail, then scroll down to the Message Arrival section. Here, you can choose whether to play a sound, show a desktop alert, or display an icon in the taskbar when a new email arrives. If you want to eliminate distractions completely, uncheck all these options to turn notifications off. I prefer not knowing the moment an email arrives because even a small notification icon in the taskbar tempts me to check my inbox, completely pulling me away from the task I’m working on.

If you still want to be notified about important emails without being interrupted by every message, you can set up a custom rule to filter alerts.
Go to File > Manage Rules & Alerts, then click New Rule. In the Rules Wizard, select Apply rule on messages I receive and click Next. Choose from people or public group, then in the lower section, click the underlined text to specify the sender or group whose emails should trigger an alert. Click Next, then select Display a Desktop Alert as the action. If you don’t need any exceptions, click Next again. Finally, name the rule, click Finish, and you’re all set.
Now, you’ll only receive notifications for high-priority emails, while everything else arrives in your inbox silently, keeping distractions to a minimum.
