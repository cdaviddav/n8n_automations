# Spot Key Emails: Auto-Color with Conditional Formatting
In this video, let’s make important emails stand out automatically with Conditional Formatting. When your inbox is packed with messages, it’s easy to overlook critical emails from key contacts or urgent tasks that need your attention. Instead of scanning line by line, you can use Conditional Formatting to highlight specific emails in different colors, making them instantly recognizable.

Conditional Formatting allows you to customize how emails appear based on sender, subject, priority level, or other email conditions. This means you can set emails from your manager to appear in bold red, highlight meeting invites in blue, or make flagged emails more noticeable. Once set up, Outlook applies these rules automatically, so important messages never get lost in the clutter.

To create a Conditional Formatting rule, go to the View tab and click View Settings. In the pop-up window, select Conditional Formatting, then click Add to create a new rule. Give it a clear name, like Highlight Manager Emails, so you can easily identify it later. Whilst the new rule is highlighted, click Font to choose how the emails should appear. You can make them bold, increase the font size, or pick a specific color to make them stand out in your inbox. 

Next, click Condition to define which emails this rule should apply to. In the pop-up window, go to the From field and type your manager’s name or email address. If you have two managers or expect emails from your manager coming from different email addresses, you can add more than one by separating them with a semicolon. In addition, you might want to tick the checkbox to only select emails where you are the only person in the To line. 
Click OK to close the Condition window, then OK again to apply the rule. Now, go back to your inbox, and you should immediately see the changes. If there are existing emails from your manager or new emails from them addressed only to you, they’ll now appear in bold red.

The example I just walked you through is exactly how I use Conditional Formatting in my daily workflow. I have emails addressed only to me from my boss appear in bold red, so they stand out immediately, ensuring I never miss them and can respond quickly if they’re urgent. But Conditional Formatting is highly flexible—you might want to explore other scenarios, like highlighting client emails, important deadlines, or meeting invites, to fit your specific needs.

Even if you just implement one rule with Conditional Formatting, I guarantee your inbox will feel much more organized and easy to scan going forward.
