# Personalize Outlook: Optimize Themes & Dark Mode
Now that we’ve set up Outlook’s layout for efficiency, let’s talk about personalizing it to make it more comfortable to use. Outlook is something you look at all day, and whether you realize it or not, the way it looks affects your productivity. A bright white screen can be harsh on the eyes, especially when you’re working long hours. And if the interface doesn’t feel intuitive, you’re constantly distracted by things that just don’t work for you. The good news is that Outlook allows you to customize its theme, color scheme, and even enable Dark Mode to create a workspace that feels better to use.

Let’s start with the possibility of changing the overall theme. Click on File, then select Options at the bottom, and go to the General tab. Under the section called "Personalize your copy of Microsoft Office," you’ll see a Theme dropdown. There are a few options here. The default Colorful theme gives each Microsoft app a distinct color, like blue for Outlook. Dark Gray is a more muted version, reducing brightness while still keeping good contrast. The White theme is a simple, clean option, but for many people, it can feel too bright. And then there’s Black, which is the full Dark Mode option, giving you a dark background across the entire interface.

After selecting your preferred theme, click OK to apply it. Keep in mind that changing the theme in Outlook will also update the theme across all your Microsoft 365 apps, ensuring a consistent look whether you're using Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. If you work across multiple Microsoft applications daily, this uniform view can help create a seamless experience.

Personally, I use Dark Gray on my desktop because it softens the brightness without making things too dark. It provides a nice balance, making the interface easier on my eyes without reducing contrast too much. I find this especially helpful when working in dimmed light in the early mornings or late evenings. If you’re not sure which theme works best for you, I recommend trying them out for a day or two and seeing which one feels most comfortable.

Now, if you're considering Black Mode, there’s one important thing to note. When you switch to Black, it also applies to the Reading Pane, meaning your emails will appear with a black background and white text. This can be great for reducing glare, but sometimes, it makes certain emails harder to read, especially if they contain custom formatting or dark-colored fonts.

If you prefer the Black theme but don’t want the Reading Pane to be dark, there’s a quick fix. Having selected an email, and near the top of the message window, you’ll see a sun and moon icon. Clicking this toggles between a dark and light background for the Reading Pane while keeping the rest of Outlook in Dark Mode. This way, you get the best of both worlds—a dark interface for comfort but a light Reading Pane for better email visibility.
One thing to keep in mind with Black Mode is that it works well for reducing glare, but sometimes emails with custom formatting or dark-colored text may not display as intended. If you run into this, you can quickly toggle the Reading Pane back to white without affecting the rest of your settings.
If you spend long hours in Outlook, maybe working early or late, these small adjustments can make a big difference. Having a theme that’s easy on your eyes can reduce fatigue, improve focus, and just make Outlook more pleasant to work with.
