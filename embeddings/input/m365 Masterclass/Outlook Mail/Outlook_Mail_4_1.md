# Find Emails Fast: Sort by Date, Sender, Subject & Attachment
Let’s start with the common challenge of finding emails quickly, especially when your inbox is overflowing. Instead of scrolling endlessly, Outlook’s sorting and filtering tools let you organize emails by date, sender, subject, or attachments so you can locate what you need in seconds.
Let’s start with sorting your inbox by date, sender, subject, or attachment. Open your inbox and look at the top of your email list. By default, Outlook sorts emails by date, with the most recent at the top. 
If you want to change the sorting, click on the small arrow or text that says “By Date” at the top of your email list and choose a different filter. Outlook offers several options to help you quickly find what you need. Selecting From groups emails by sender, making it easy to locate all messages from a specific person. Choosing Subject organizes emails alphabetically by topic, which is useful for tracking ongoing conversations. If you’re looking for an email with an attachment, selecting Attachments will bring all emails containing files to the top. You can also sort by Categories to group emails by assigned labels, Size to find large emails that may be taking up space, or Flagged to quickly see messages marked for follow-up.

Personally, I usually keep my inbox sorted by date, but after a long vacation or absence, I switch to sorting by type. This separates meeting invites from regular emails, allowing me to quickly spot and respond to any urgent meeting requests before diving into the rest of my inbox.
If you have sub-folders under your inbox, then you can change the sorting for each folder individually. For example: you can have your inbox sorted by date and a sub-folder with important emails sorted by sender. 
Once you get comfortable with sorting and filtering your inbox, finding emails becomes effortless. Instead of wasting time scrolling, you’ll have a structured way to retrieve exactly what you need, when you need it.
