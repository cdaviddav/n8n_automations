# Cut Typing Time: Extract Text from Images with OCR
Let’s start and look at how to save time by extracting text from images using OneNote’s built-in OCR feature.

We’ve all come across situations where we need to copy text from a photo, screenshot, scanned document, or even a slide from a presentation. Instead of retyping everything manually, OneNote can recognize the text inside those images and let you copy it instantly. This feature—called Optical Character Recognition, or OCR—can save you a lot of time, especially if you’re working with printed handouts, whiteboard snapshots, or any visual reference that includes text.

To try it out, just insert an image into your OneNote page. You can do this by dragging and dropping a file, pasting a screenshot, or using the Insert tab to add a picture.

Once the image is in place, right-click on it and choose “Copy Text from Picture.” OneNote will scan the image in the background and copy the recognized text to your clipboard. Then, you can paste it anywhere—into the same page, another note, or even into a Word document.

The quality of the result depends on the clarity and structure of the image. If the text is clean, well-aligned, and in a standard font, OneNote usually does a solid job of recognizing and extracting it. But if the image contains overlapping text boxes, inconsistent formatting, or is poorly aligned—as is often the case with complex presentations or scanned printouts—then the results can be a bit messy and may require cleanup.

I’ve personally found this feature especially helpful when working with presentation screenshots or photos of whiteboards after a workshop, where capturing key points quickly matters more than perfect formatting.

One thing to note is that OCR might not be available right away for very large or high-resolution images—it can take a few seconds for OneNote to process them. But in most cases, it works pretty quickly.
