# Find Notes Fast: Navigate Notebooks, Sections & Pages
First of all, let’s look at how to quickly find your notes by navigating notebooks, sections, and pages in OneNote.

As your OneNote usage grows, it’s easy to lose track of where things are. Learning how to navigate notebooks, sections, and pages helps you find what you need more quickly and work more efficiently.

OneNote is structured around three main levels: notebooks, sections, and pages. Think of a notebook like a binder. Each section is a tab in that binder, and each page is a sheet of paper in the tab. Once you understand this hierarchy, finding things becomes a lot easier.

The very left panel in OneNote shows all your currently open notebooks and sections. You can extend and collapse notebooks to view or hide their sections, and add new sections using the "Add Section" button. If you want to create a new notebook, go to File > New, then choose whether to save it to your OneDrive or your local computer. You can name your notebook and click Create to start using it right away. To open an existing notebook that's not currently open, go to File > Open, then select a notebook from your recent list or browse OneDrive or your local folders to locate it.

Once you're inside a notebook, you'll see the sections either at the top or along the left side—this depends on your version of OneNote. We’ll cover how to adjust the layout in a bit, but for now, just know that sections are a great way to group related pages together. For example, I usually have notebooks for overarching themes and then within one, I create a section for each major project or client, and then use pages inside to break things down further—like meeting notes, planning, or brainstorming.

To switch between sections or pages, just click them from the list. If you're using lots of pages, you can scroll through the list or use the search bar to jump straight to what you need. A tip I use often: start the title of each page with a clear keyword or date so it’s easier to find later.

One last thing that helps me navigate faster: collapsing the page list when I don’t need it. This gives me more screen space to focus, especially when presenting or reviewing something with others.
