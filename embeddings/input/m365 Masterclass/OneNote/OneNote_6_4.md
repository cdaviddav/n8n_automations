# Connected Notes: Integrate OneNote with Loop
In this video, let’s explore how OneNote works with Microsoft Loop to bring your notes into a more flexible and collaborative environment.

OneNote is a great tool for capturing and organizing ideas—whether you're using it for personal notes, structured project planning, or as a knowledge hub. But sometimes, you need those notes to contribute more actively to your team’s workflow. Instead of jumping between tools, it can be helpful to connect your OneNote content directly to a shared, collaborative workspace. That’s where Microsoft Loop comes in.

There are two main ways to integrate OneNote with Microsoft Loop. The first—and more dynamic—method is embedding Loop components directly into your OneNote pages. To do this, go to the Insert tab in OneNote and select Loop Component. A dropdown will appear with a range of options. At the top, you’ll see simple components like Paragraph, Table, or Code. Below that, you’ll find pre-built templates like Task List, Voting Table, or Q&A.

Once you select a component, it’s placed directly into your OneNote page. You can move it around just like any other element. The component appears with a rounded border, and while you’re working inside that space, you’re essentially editing live Loop content—just inside the OneNote interface.

You can even use the slash command within the component to add more Loop elements, just like you would in Loop itself. It’s a great way to extend OneNote with flexible, updatable content blocks that stay synced with the rest of your tools.

If you want to share the Loop component more widely, click the Share icon in the upper-right corner of the component. You can copy the link and paste it into an Outlook email, a Teams chat, or even another Loop workspace. The component stays live wherever it goes, so any edits made in one place are instantly reflected across all the others.

This is particularly helpful when you want to combine the structure of OneNote with the real-time flexibility of Loop—for example, drafting tasks, collecting feedback, or co-editing a table without leaving your notes.

Now, you might be wondering: where does the component actually live once you’ve added it to a OneNote page? That part is simple—it lives in your personal Loop space and is stored in OneDrive. You can find your Loop components in Loop under Recent pages and components. It’s not tied to a specific Loop workspace or page unless you move it there manually.

Additionally if you search for Loop components, you can find them in in OneDrive under the folders “Attachments”.

The second major way to connect OneNote and loop is via links. In fact, this is great when you do not only want to share and collaborate on one single component but maybe link entire pages. As you might know, every page and component in Loop has a unique URL, so if you want to reference Loop content inside OneNote, just grab the link and paste it into your notebook. You can even add a short line of context above it—like “See shared planning board in Loop”—so it’s clear what it refers to. Clicking that link from OneNote will open the component in the Loop web version.

You can do the same the other way around. If you want to link to OneNote content from within Loop, just grab the page link from OneNote. To do that, right-click on the relevant page in OneNote’s sidebar and select Copy Link to Page. Then paste it into your Loop page where it fits. If you want to link to an entire notebook, click the Share button in the top-right corner of OneNote and choose Copy link to notebook. Once pasted into Loop, anyone with access will be able to open it—so make sure the permissions are set accordingly.

I use these small link-backs often in my projects to bridge the two tools. OneNote is still my go-to for rough ideas and longform personal notes, but Loop is where things get turned into structured, shareable content. Linking between the two helps me stay organized without duplicating effort.
