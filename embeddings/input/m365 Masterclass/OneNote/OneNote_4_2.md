# Keep It All Together: Embed Files & Links
Next, let’s look at how to keep all your key resources in one place by embedding files and links into your OneNote notes.

Once you've got your templates set up, it's time to bring everything together so you don’t have to jump between apps, folders, or shared drives just to get your work done. OneNote lets you keep everything connected—documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and even relevant links—right inside the note where you're doing your thinking.

To embed a file, just drag and drop it directly into the page, or use the Insert tab and click on File Attachment. You’ll have two options: you can either insert the file as an attachment, which shows a clickable icon, or you can insert it as a printout, which displays the content directly on the page as a picture. Personally, I prefer attaching the full file so I can access all its contents without cluttering up the page. But if it’s just a single image or one specific page I need to reference, then I go with the printout option to keep things simple and visible at a glance.

You can also insert links. If you're referencing a web resource, a shared file, or even another page in OneNote, just paste the link or use the Insert tab and click Link. If you just paste the link, for example, with CTRL +C, the original link will be displayed. If you want a cleaner display name and actual link in the background, click on Link in the insert tab, then paste the link in the address field and define another, cleaner text to display.

You can also insert other types of content, like images, audio notes, or Excel spreadsheets, using the Insert tab. When it comes to spreadsheets, OneNote gives you a few flexible options depending on what you need. Click the Spreadsheet button in the Insert tab and choose whether to insert an existing file or create a new one. If you create a new spreadsheet, OneNote will add an Excel icon along with a preview that shows the upper-left portion of the spreadsheet directly on the page. You can double-click the icon or click "Edit" to open and work on the spreadsheet in Excel. If you prefer to keep your notes cleaner, you can delete the preview and just leave the icon as a placeholder for quick access.
