# Manage Projects: Link OneNote with Planner
Next up: Let’s look at how you can use OneNote alongside Microsoft Planner to better manage your projects.

OneNote is great for organizing your thoughts, meeting notes, and reference materials, while Planner gives you a clear visual of task progress and responsibilities. When used together, they give you both the context and structure you need to keep projects moving forward.

While there’s no direct integration button between OneNote and Planner like there is with Outlook, you can still link the two easily. Start by opening your plan in Microsoft Planner. Find the specific task you want to reference, click on the three dots, and select “Copy link to task.” Then go back to OneNote and paste that link into the relevant note. If you paste using CTRL + V, OneNote will display the link using the task’s name, which makes it easier to read and reference.

This is especially useful when you're taking meeting notes or outlining next steps. You can link out to Planner tasks so that anyone reviewing the notes can go directly to the associated task in Planner.

You can also go the other way—link a OneNote page to a Planner task. To do that, go to the page in OneNote, right-click it in the page list, and select “Copy Link to Page.” Then, open the task in Microsoft Planner and paste the link into the Notes field. If you paste it with CTRL + V, the name of the OneNote Page will be displayed, and the link will take you to OneNote web to view the page.

If your team uses Microsoft Teams, this integration becomes even more powerful. You can add both OneNote and Planner as tabs in the same Team or Channel, so everyone has direct access to the same notes, tasks, and updates without jumping between apps.

We’ll cover how to add those tabs to your Teams Channel in the Teams module—but up next, we’ll dive into how OneNote integrates with Teams to make collaboration even smoother.
