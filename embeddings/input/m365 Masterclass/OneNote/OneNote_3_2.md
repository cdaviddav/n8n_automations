# Streamline Workflow: Sort & Rearrange Pages
In this video, let’s take a look at how to sort and rearrange your pages and sections to keep your notebooks clear and easy to work with.

Now that your notebooks are structured and grouped, the next step is learning how to keep things organized as they evolve. As you add more pages and sections, things can quickly get messy unless you know how to stay on top of it.

Let’s start with the most basic method: drag and drop. To move a page, section or even a notebook, just click and drag it to a new position in your list. You can rearrange the order manually, which is great if you like to keep notes in a certain flow—like putting the most recent documents at the top or grouping similar topics together.

If you’re using subpages, you can also rearrange their order or promote and demote them. For example, if a subpage becomes more important over time, right-click and choose "Promote Subpage" to move it up one level. If you want to group pages temporarily under a single header, you can demote them and collapse the group to keep your workspace tidy.

Even though you can sort pages, sections, or notebooks manually, OneNote also supports automatic sorting—but only for pages. You can sort them by date created, date modified, or alphabetically. To do this, click on the down arrow with the three horizontal lines in the top right corner of the page list. From there, choose whether you want to sort by name, date created, date modified, or select "None" to turn off sorting. This feature is especially helpful in sections where you collect notes continuously, like meeting records or journal entries. That said, I still prefer manual sorting for project-specific sections, as it lets me group related content in the order that makes the most sense for how I work.
