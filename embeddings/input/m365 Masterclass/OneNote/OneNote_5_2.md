# Capture Everything: Dictate & Transcribe Audio Notes
Next up: Let’s explore how you can capture everything—even when you don’t feel like typing—by recording and transcribing audio notes in OneNote.

Sometimes you’re in a situation where writing or typing isn’t practical or even impossible. Maybe you’re in a meeting, a lecture, or just out for a walk and want to capture a thought quickly. That’s where OneNote’s audio recording feature comes in handy. It lets you record directly into a note and even transcribes the content so you can refer back to it later in text form.

To get started, go to the Home tab and you’ll find two powerful tools for audio: the Dictate feature and the Transcribe feature.

Use Dictate when you want to speak your notes out loud and have them converted into text in real time. It’s perfect for quickly getting ideas down when typing would slow you down. Just click Dictate, start talking, and OneNote will write it all out for you as you speak. You can continue dictating or pause and resume as needed.

If you want to capture longer conversations or recordings, like meetings or interviews, the Transcribe feature in the Home tab is your go-to tool. You can either record audio directly or upload a pre-recorded file. Click the upper part of the Transcribe button to open the sidebar, where you can choose between these two options and set your preferred language.

Once the audio is uploaded or recorded, OneNote will generate a full transcript right in the sidebar. The tool can even identify and label different speakers and allows you to jump to specific parts of the recording by clicking on the text.

Transcription accuracy depends on audio quality and how clearly people speak. It's most reliable in quiet environments with minimal background noise and one speaker. In more dynamic settings, you might need to make a few manual corrections.

While I don’t use these features regularly myself, I’ve seen a colleague rely on them heavily during a time when typing was difficult—like when he had an injured hand—and it worked really well for capturing and organizing everything verbally.
