# Save Research Fast: Use OneNote Web Clipper
Let's move on and look at how to save articles, webpages, and research snippets directly into OneNote using the OneNote Web Clipper.

If you do a lot of online research or simply come across helpful content during the day, copying and pasting into your notes can quickly become tedious. That’s where the OneNote Web Clipper comes in—it helps you save web content to OneNote in just a couple of clicks, with the layout and links intact.

The Web Clipper is a browser extension that works with most major browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. If you don’t have it yet, just search for “OneNote Web Clipper” and install it from the Microsoft Add-ins site or your browser’s extension store.

Once it’s installed, you’ll see the OneNote icon in your toolbar. If you're using Chrome, you might need to pin the extension first. To do that, click on the puzzle-shaped Extensions icon in the toolbar, then click the pin icon next to OneNote Web Clipper so it appears permanently in your browser bar.

Now, when you find something you want to save—an article, blog post, research finding, or even a recipe—click the icon. You’ll be asked to log in with your Microsoft account if it’s your first time.

You can then choose from a few different clip options: full page, region, article, or bookmark. I typically use “Article” for blog posts and long reads—it strips away ads and sidebars and keeps the text clean. The “Full Page” option saves everything as you see it, which is great for visually rich pages.

Next, you can adjust the title if needed and add any additional notes to provide context. If you’ve chosen to clip a region, you also have the option to select and add more regions before finalizing.

After that, use the dropdown menu to choose the notebook and section where you want the content saved. Once you're ready, click "Clip," and the content will be sent directly to OneNote.

The clipped content appears in OneNote as a new page. From there, you can annotate it, highlight key ideas, or add your own comments—everything stays in one place for easy reference.
