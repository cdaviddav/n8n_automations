# Track Tasks Better: Sync Notes to Outlook, ToDo & Planner
Next, let’s look at how to track tasks more effectively by linking them from OneNote to Outlook—and how to manage them in To Do or Planner if needed.

When you’re taking notes during meetings or planning your day in OneNote, it’s natural to jot down tasks on the fly. But if you want to make sure those tasks don’t get lost, the best option is to flag them using Outlook Tasks directly from OneNote.

To do this, go to the Home tab in OneNote, click anywhere on the line of text you want to turn into a task, and select the Outlook Tasks button. You can assign a due date like Today, Tomorrow, or even a custom date. OneNote will then mark the task with a red flag and send it to your Outlook task list.

Now, here’s something important to know: tasks flagged in OneNote will first appear in Outlook’s task view. From there, they sync automatically to Microsoft To Do and Planner—but this can take a few seconds or minutes. So if you don’t see them right away, just wait a bit before checking in your other apps.

For example, if you flag a to-do in OneNote for today, it will show up in the Outlook to-do bar in the bottom right corner of your email view. After a short delay, the same task will also appear in the Tasks view and because you set the due date to today, that task is shown also in the smart lists Planned and depending on your settings also in the list My Day in To Do. In Planner you see the task in the My Tasks plan  under the Private Tasks filter.

Personally, I love how seamless this integration is. It works across the Microsoft ecosystem without any manual setup, so when I flag something in OneNote, I know I’ll see it across all my other tools as well.

Once the task is marked as complete—whether in Outlook, To Do, or Planner—it will disappear from your active lists and move to the completed section. However, in OneNote, there’s no visual update to show that the task was completed, so you’ll need to check your task manager if you want to confirm it’s been done.
