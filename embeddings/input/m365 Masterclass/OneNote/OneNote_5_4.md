# Digitize Handwriting: Convert Ink to Text & Math
In this video, let’s look at how to convert your handwritten notes or equations into digital text using OneNote’s Ink to Text and Ink to Math features.

If you use a stylus or touchscreen device to take notes by hand, OneNote gives you the flexibility of traditional handwriting with the added benefit of digital structure. But reviewing or organizing handwritten notes can be tough, especially when you want to search them later, share with others, or clean things up. That’s where converting ink to text or math can really help.

To get started, open a page where you’ve written something using a stylus or your finger. Make sure you’re in Draw mode—click the Draw tab and choose the pen you want to use. Once you’ve written something, switch to the Select or lasso select tool, and draw a shape around the handwriting you want to convert.

Once the handwriting is selected, click "Ink to Text" in the Draw tab. OneNote will instantly convert your handwriting into typed text, while trying to preserve the original formatting and alignment. That said, the conversion may not be perfect—especially if your handwriting is unclear or varies in size. It's a good idea to quickly review the result and make any necessary corrections. Still, it’s a great way to clean up handwritten notes, especially for meeting summaries, to-do lists, or rough ideas you want to organize later.

For equations, the process is similar. Write your equation using the pen tool, select it with the lasso, and then click "Ink to Math." This opens the Ink to Math editor, where you can review and correct the recognized equation. You can fix numbers, symbols, or terms that were misread, erase parts, or clear everything if needed. Once you're happy with how it looks, click Insert, and OneNote will place the equation into your note as editable math text. This feature is especially helpful for students, engineers, or anyone working with formulas who wants a cleaner, more professional presentation—or plans to reuse the equation elsewhere.
