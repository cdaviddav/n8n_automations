# Navigate Easily: Create a Clickable Table of Contents
Next up: Let’s make navigating large notebooks easier by creating a clickable table of contents.

Once you start adding more pages to your sections—especially in project notebooks or documentation—it can become harder to find what you need at a glance. Scrolling through a long list of pages isn’t the most efficient way to work, and it’s easy to miss something important. That’s where a simple, clickable table of contents can make all the difference.

The idea is simple: you can create a single page at the top of your section that acts like an index, or even add a mini agenda at the top of an individual notes page. In both cases, you list out key pages or sections of content and link directly to them. This gives you a clear overview of what's inside the notebook or note and lets you jump to the right content instantly.

Here’s how you do it. First, create a new page at the top of your section. Give it a clear name like "Table of Contents" or something similar. Then, go through your section and decide which pages you want to include. These could be the most important notes, key steps in a process, or anything you want quick access to.

Now go to each page you want to include, right-click on it in the page list, and select "Copy Link to Page." Then go back to your new table of contents page and paste the link there with CTRL + V. Repeat that for each page you want to include. You’ll end up with a clean list of clickable links that act like shortcuts to the rest of your notes.

When you copy a link to a page using CTRL+C and CTRL+V, OneNote includes both the link and the page name. If you'd like to change how that text appears, just click on the pasted link, right-click it, and choose Edit Link. In the window that pops up, you can customize the display name under "Text to display."

You can use the same approach to create agendas within a single note. Just highlight a heading or section you'd like to link to, right-click, and choose "Copy Link to Paragraph." Then paste that link at the top of your page. This creates a clickable agenda within your note. If you want to rename the link text, simply follow the same Edit Link steps.

It would be great if OneNote had a built-in table of contents feature like Word does, but this method works just as well for most situations. Just keep in mind that the links won’t update automatically if you rename or move the original content.
