# Work Together: Collaborate in Real Time
First of all, let’s talk about how to collaborate with others using OneNote—whether you’re working with a small team or across departments.

OneNote is often seen as a personal productivity tool, but it really shines when you use it to collaborate. With shared notebooks, your team can co-author plans, meeting notes, project documentation, and more—all in real time, without emailing files back and forth.

Here’s how to share a notebook and start collaborating.

If you're using OneNote for Microsoft 365 and your notebook is stored in OneDrive or SharePoint, then you're already set up to collaborate. To share the notebook, just open it and click the Share button in the top-right corner. A panel will appear with different sharing options: you can either invite people by email or create a link to share.

If you choose to invite people directly, you’ll see a window where you can enter their email addresses and set specific permissions—like whether they can edit or only view the notebook. You can also define an expiration date for the link or even set a password if you want to control access more tightly.

If you prefer to share a link instead, OneNote will automatically generate a link that gives both view and edit access by default. You can change those permissions by clicking the dropdown next to the link and selecting “View only” if you don’t want others to make changes. I usually keep edit access turned on so team members can jump in and contribute right away.

Once your teammates open the notebook, they can jump in and start editing right away. You’ll see their initials next to any changes they make, and OneNote will sync those updates in real time. There’s no need to save or refresh—everything happens automatically.

Now let’s talk about individual pages. OneNote doesn’t support setting permissions for a single page inside a shared notebook. If you want to share just one page—like meeting minutes or a finalized checklist—you can export it as a PDF or email it directly from OneNote. Just keep in mind that this creates a static snapshot. The recipient won’t be able to co-author or edit the content in real time—you’re simply sending a copy for reference, not for collaboration.

When multiple people collaborate in the same notebook, OneNote tracks who added what by showing small initials next to newly added content. These indicators help you spot updates at a glance. Once you've reviewed the new content, you can mark those changes as read so the highlights and initials disappear. To do that, simply right-click anywhere on the updated page and choose “Mark as Read.” Alternatively, you can go to the Review tab and click “Mark as Read” from the ribbon. It’s a simple way to keep things tidy and stay on top of what’s changed since your last visit.

And if something is accidentally changed or deleted, you don’t need to panic. OneNote keeps a full version history of each page, so you can go back and restore previous versions if needed. Here’s how: Right-click on the page title in the sidebar and select “Show Page Versions.” This will show a list of previous versions along with the date and the author of the change. Click on any version to view it, and if you want to bring it back, just copy the content or restore the full version by right-clicking and selecting the respective option.

If your team uses Microsoft Teams, you can take collaboration even further by pinning a shared notebook—or even a specific page—directly in your Teams channel as a tab. That way, everyone has quick access to live notes alongside chat and tasks. We’ll walk through exactly how to do that in the Teams module.
