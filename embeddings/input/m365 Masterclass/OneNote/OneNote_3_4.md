# Prioritize Smarter: Use Tags for Tasks & Categories
In this video, let’s look at how you can use tags in OneNote to prioritize and categorize your notes more effectively.

As your notebooks grow, it’s not just about finding the right page—it’s also about surfacing the right content within a page. This is where tags can be incredibly helpful. Whether you want to flag important items, mark things to follow up on, or keep track of tasks, OneNote’s tagging system gives you an extra layer of control.

Tags are small icons or labels that you can apply to individual lines or paragraphs in your notes. You can access them from the Home tab. Just highlight the text you want to tag and click the tag icon to open the dropdown menu. If you prefer, you can also apply a tag first and then type your note next to it. The built-in tags include options like To Do, Important, Question, and Remember for Later, which are great for quickly marking items that need your attention.

I often use the To Do tag for action items during meetings. It gives me a visual checklist that I can check off right inside the note. For key takeaways or follow-ups, I use the Important or Remember for Later tags. This makes it easy to scan a page and quickly spot what needs attention.

But you’re not limited to the built-in tags—you can also create your own. Scroll to the bottom of the tag menu and select “Customize Tags.” From there, you can either edit an existing tag or create a brand new one. When creating a custom tag, you can choose a name, a symbol, and even a highlight color to make it stand out. This is great if you want to tailor your tagging system to match your own workflow or team-specific processes.

One of the best things about tags in OneNote is that they’re searchable. You can click “Find Tags” in the Home tab, and it will open a summary pane that shows you all the tags across your notebooks. You can filter by tag type, section, title, date, or even by notebook at the bottom of the pane. This is especially useful when you’re following up on tasks or trying to gather everything related to a specific topic.

You can also take it one step further by creating a summary page of your tags. After clicking “Find Tags” in the Home tab, you’ll see the option at the bottom of the pane to “Create Summary Page.” This adds a new page to your notebook that lists all tagged content currently shown in the summary view, along with clickable links to each item. It’s a great way to quickly review and prioritize tasks across a section or entire notebook, especially before a meeting or weekly review.

I personally use this feature when I want to clean up or follow up on all my tagged to-dos in one go. It saves me from jumping back and forth between notes and gives me a clear action plan.
