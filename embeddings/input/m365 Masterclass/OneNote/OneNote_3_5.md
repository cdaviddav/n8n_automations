# Find Anything Instantly: Master OneNote Search
Let’s continue and make sure you can always find what you’re looking for—no matter where it’s stored—by mastering OneNote’s search tools.

Once your notebooks start to grow, navigation alone isn’t enough. You might remember a keyword, a phrase, or even just a rough idea of something you wrote—but not where you saved it. That’s where OneNote’s search features come in.

To start searching, use the search box located in the top right corner above your page view—or press the shortcut Ctrl+F to search within the current page. Just be careful not to confuse this with the general search bar at the very top center of the OneNote window, which is part of the Microsoft 365 interface and serves a different purpose—it searches for help topics and commands beyond OneNote rather than your actual notes.

By default, OneNote searches within your current notebook. If you want to broaden the search, click into the search bar and open the dropdown menu to change the scope. You can choose to search only the current section, the current notebook, or all notebooks. This gives you the flexibility to narrow your search or look across everything you've stored in OneNote.

After entering a keyword or phrase, OneNote instantly searches your page titles and text content, updating the results as you type. I usually begin with a broad term and then narrow it down by notebook or section if the list is too long. For even more precision, you can pin the search pane by clicking "Pin Search Results" at the bottom left of the search popup. Once the search panel is pinned to the right side of your screen, you can filter results further by section, title, or date modified—making it much easier to pinpoint exactly what you need.

What’s really useful is that OneNote also supports OCR, or optical character recognition. This means it can search text inside images, screenshots, and scanned documents. So if you took a picture of a whiteboard or saved a screenshot with text in it, you can still find it just by typing a keyword. It doesn’t always work perfectly, but most of the time it’s surprisingly accurate.

If you use a stylus or write notes by hand, OneNote can also search your handwriting—assuming it’s somewhat readable. It uses handwriting recognition to scan and index your handwritten notes, so they show up in your search results just like typed content. This is especially helpful if you use OneNote on a tablet or during brainstorming sessions.
