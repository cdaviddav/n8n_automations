# Stay Organized: Structure Notebooks Like a Pro
Let’s set up your OneNote so it’s organized and easy to navigate.

Now that you’ve customized the layout to suit your preferences, the next step is to give your notebooks a clear structure. A bit of upfront organization goes a long way—it can save you time and help you feel more in control. If you’ve ever found yourself jumping between pages or forgetting where a note lives, let's fix that.

We’ve already gone over the basic structure of OneNote: at the top level, you have notebooks, which contain sections, and each section holds individual pages. You can also group related pages together using subpages. To create a subpage, just drag a page slightly to the right until it indents underneath another page. You can go two levels deep with subpages, and both levels can be collapsed under the main page to keep things tidy. Alternatively, right-click any page and choose "Make Subpage" or "Promote" to adjust its level. This adds another layer of structure that helps keep your notes more organized, especially when working on ongoing projects or collections of related information.

The key to making this structure work is to set up notebooks based on broad topics or areas of responsibility. For example, I have one notebook dedicated to projects and another for administrative work. Keeping these areas separate helps reduce clutter and makes it easier to find what I need without scanning through unrelated notes.

Inside each notebook, I use sections to break things down into more specific categories. In my Projects notebook, for instance, each project has its own section. And within each section, I use pages for meeting notes, workshops, or follow-ups.

If you’re working on a larger project with multiple categories or subtopics, section groups can help keep everything in one place without overwhelming your main section list. To create one, right-click anywhere in the section list and choose "New Section Group." You can then drag and drop existing sections into the group. This is especially useful for long-term projects or work that spans multiple phases or departments.

Naming conventions are another small but powerful way to keep things organized. Try to be clear and consistent and add dates or years where helpful. For example, I always use a short prefix for recurring topics—like “MTG” for meeting notes or “PLN” for planning. It keeps the sections and pages visually aligned and easier to scan, especially when you’re quickly searching for something.

And here’s a little tip I’ve picked up over time: when naming sections or pages, try to keep them short but meaningful. Long titles get cut off, especially if you're working with the vertical tabs layout. So instead of writing “Meeting with Jordan about Q2 Budget Forecasting,” I’ll just call it “MTG Jordan Q2 Budget.” It’s faster, neater, and easier to navigate.
