# Save Time: Use Templates for Notes & Plans
First of all, let’s look at how you can save time, mental effort, and stay consistent by using templates in OneNote.

Even with a solid system in place, starting from a blank page every time can slow you down. Templates in OneNote help you skip the setup by letting you reuse consistent layouts for things like meetings, projects, or weekly reviews.

Let’s start with the built-in templates. In OneNote, go to the Insert tab and click on the drop down Page Templates. You’ll see a list of pre-made templates for things like meeting notes, to-do lists, and project overviews. Just click one, and it will apply the structure to your current page.

If you want a full overview of all the available templates, either scroll to the bottom of the dropdown list and click "Page Templates," or click the upper part of the Page Templates button. This will open a sidebar where you can browse all templates grouped by category, making it easier to explore what's available.

But honestly, I rarely use the built-in ones. I find it much more useful to create my own custom templates—because then they actually match how I work.

To create your own template, start by setting up a page exactly the way you want it. Add your usual elements like headers, tables, or checklists. If you prefer, you can also use one of the built-in templates as a starting point and modify it to suit your needs. When you're happy with the layout, go back to the Page Templates menu and choose "Save current page as a template" at the bottom. Give it a clear name, and if you’d like every new page in the current section to use it automatically, just check the box provided.

For example, I use different meeting note templates for different types of meetings—like team jour fixes, one-on-ones, or steering committees. That way, I don’t have to think about what to include each time. My notes are already structured and ready to go as soon as the meeting starts.

One thing to note is that templates are only available in the OneNote desktop app as part of Microsoft 365. If you're using OneNote for Windows 10, you won’t see the Page Templates option. In that case, the best workaround is to create your own template page manually and duplicate it each time you need it.
