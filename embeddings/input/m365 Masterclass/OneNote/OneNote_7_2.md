# Send Notes Easily: Export as Email or PDF
Next up: Let’s look at how to quickly send or save notes by exporting them as an email or PDF.

Sometimes you don’t need to collaborate in real time—you just want to share a finished page, send out meeting notes, or archive important information. OneNote gives you a couple of easy ways to do that: you can either email the page directly or export it as a PDF. Both options are great when you want to share static versions of your notes with others.

Let’s start with email. Go to the File menu, select Send, and choose Email Page. Alternatively, you can click on the share button in the top right corner of OneNote and select Email Copy of Page. This opens a new message in Outlook with the contents of your current OneNote page already embedded in the body of the email. You can add your recipients, a subject line, and send it right away. This method is perfect for sharing meeting summaries, checklists, or quick updates with your team. Keep in mind that the person receiving it doesn’t need OneNote—they’ll see the content directly in the email.

Alternatively, you can export and send a page as a PDF. Just go to the File menu, select Send, and choose Send as PDF. This generates a PDF version of the current page and opens a new Outlook email draft with the file already attached—ready to send. It’s a more formal and professional way to share polished notes, summaries, or reports, especially when you want to avoid pasting the raw page content directly into the body of an email.

In addition to sending a page as a PDF, the same menu also gives you the option to send the page to Word or even publish it to a blog, depending on your setup. These options are helpful if you want to continue editing in Word or share content externally in a more structured format.

If you’re not looking to email the file, but simply want to save a version of your notes, go to the File menu and choose Export. There, you can decide whether you want to export just the current page, an entire section, or the full notebook. Under file format, select PDF, then choose a location and click Save. This gives you a clean, portable copy of your notes that you can store, attach to other documents, or send through any platform you prefer.

In addition to PDF, you’ll also see other file format options like Word (.docx) or OneNote Package (.onepkg). Exporting to Word lets you continue working on the content outside of OneNote, while the OneNote Package is useful if you want to move or back up an entire notebook with all its structure and formatting intact.

Just keep in mind—emailing or exporting notes creates a static copy. That means others can read the information, but they won’t be able to co-edit or comment directly. If collaboration is your goal, it’s always better to share the live notebook instead.
