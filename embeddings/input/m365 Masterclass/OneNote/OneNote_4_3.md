# Focus Better: Use OneNote’s Immersive Reader
Now, let’s take a look at a feature in OneNote that can really help you focus and improve how you review your notes—the Immersive Reader.

If you've ever found yourself skimming a long note, getting distracted, or struggling to focus while reviewing your own writing, you're not alone. Especially when your notes are dense or detailed, it can be hard to stay engaged. The Immersive Reader helps by simplifying how text is displayed and giving you tools that reduce distractions and support better comprehension.

To launch Immersive Reader, go to the View tab and click on Immersive Reader. This opens your note in a full-screen, clean view, removing all the extra navigation panes and distractions.

Once you're in Immersive Reader, you can adjust how the text looks and sounds to make reading more comfortable. Click the "Aa" icon in the upper right corner to change text size, spacing, or page theme. Next to that, click the open book icon to access reading preferences like line focus, which highlights one line at a time to help reduce distractions.

In the grammar section, you can turn on features like "Syllables" to break words into parts, or "Parts of Speech" to highlight nouns, verbs, and adjectives in different colors. These tools can be really helpful when proofreading or trying to better understand the flow and structure of your notes.

If you'd rather listen than read, click the Play button at the bottom. OneNote will read the text out loud, and you can change the voice and reading speed using the settings right next to it.

One thing to keep in mind is that Immersive Reader is a read-only view. You won’t be able to edit or adjust the actual note content while you’re in this mode.

To return to your regular workspace, just click the arrow in the top-left corner to exit Immersive Reader.
