# Sync Seamlessly: Link OneNote with Outlook
First of all, let’s explore how to connect OneNote with Outlook to bring your notes and meetings into one smooth workflow.

If you’re already using Outlook to manage your calendar and emails, it makes a lot of sense to link it with your notes. Whether you're preparing for meetings, taking notes during them, or following up afterward, syncing OneNote with Outlook helps you stay organized and saves time.

One of the most practical ways to do this is by linking your notes to calendar events. You might already know that you can create meeting notes directly from Outlook. But you can also go the other way—start from OneNote and link a note to a meeting from your Outlook calendar.

To do this, go to the Home tab in OneNote and click on “Meeting Details.” This opens a sidebar on the right that displays your Outlook calendar. First, select the date, then choose the meeting you want to pull in. OneNote will insert key details into your page—including the meeting title, time, location, attendees, and a link to the original calendar event. You can then jot down your notes right below it.

Keep in mind that the meeting info will be inserted wherever your cursor is on the page. So if you want to start fresh, create a new page before selecting the meeting.

Also, if a page is already linked to one meeting and you try to insert another set of meeting details, OneNote will warn you. You’ll have the option to confirm or cancel before adding the second set of details.

I find this especially useful during back-to-back meetings—it helps me prep faster, keep all the context in one place, and avoid jumping between apps.
