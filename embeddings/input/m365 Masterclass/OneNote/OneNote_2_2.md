# Work Smarter: Customize OneNote’s Layout & Settings
As previously mentioned, let’s make OneNote feel more like your own space by customizing the layout and some other key settings.

Now that you know how to navigate notebooks, sections, and pages, it’s time to tweak the workspace to make it more comfortable and efficient. The default setup in OneNote works fine, but with a few simple changes, you can make it fit the way you think and work.

Let’s start with the layout. Depending on your version of OneNote, you might see the notebooks and page list on either the left or right, and the sections across the top. There are a few variations available, so it's worth exploring the settings to find what works best for your setup.

You can adjust the layout by going to File, then Options, and selecting Display. There, you’ll find checkboxes to control how horizontal tabs are shown. Alternatively, you can head to the View tab and switch between vertical and horizontal tab layouts.

To keep things consistent in this module, I’ll be using the vertical tabs layout through the View tab. Once this view is active, the horizontal layout settings are no longer relevant, which actually simplifies things. I personally prefer vertical tabs because they create a cleaner interface and make it easier to switch between notebooks, sections, and pages.

Another layout option I find really useful is the Dock to Desktop feature. This allows you to pin OneNote to the side of your screen so you can take notes while working in another app, like a browser or Outlook. To use it, go to the View tab and select "Dock to Desktop." OneNote will automatically move to the right side of your screen and stay visible while you work in other windows. You can also switch between other apps, which will open on the left side automatically—no need to manually resize windows or adjust the layout yourself. If you want to exit this view, just click on the arrow in the top right corner and OneNote will extent to full-screen again. I often use this while in meetings or reviewing documents—it helps me take notes without flipping back and forth between apps.

What's also quite useful is that you can control the way your page looks by default. Under the View tab, you’ll see options for Rule Lines and Grid Lines. You can choose between different line styles, just like in a physical notebook. This can be especially helpful for keeping your notes aligned or if you're writing by hand using a stylus. You can apply rule or gridlines to any new page by selecting a style from the dropdown in the View tab. If you want to make this your default setting, you can enable the option to always create pages with rule or grid lines. This will apply your last selected style to all new pages going forward, until you turn the option off again. It's a handy way to keep your notes visually consistent without having to set it every time.

Finally, let’s talk about another form of visual customization: changing the background color of your pages. You can do this from the View tab by selecting Page Color and choosing one of the available options. While it’s a nice way to visually separate different types of notes, keep in mind that OneNote doesn’t currently allow you to set a default page color—so you’ll need to apply it manually for each new page.
