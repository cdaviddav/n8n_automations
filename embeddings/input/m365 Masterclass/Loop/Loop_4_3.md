# Brainstorm Better: Use Loop’s Content Block Templates
In this video, let’s take a look at how you can brainstorm more effectively using Loop’s built-in content block templates.

So far, you’ve seen how to co-author pages, share content, and collaborate in real time. But when it comes to brainstorming—especially with a group—starting from a blank page can slow things down. That’s exactly where Loop’s templates come in. They give you a ready-to-go structure that helps spark ideas, keep discussions focused, and make sure no good thought gets lost.

To access content block templates in Loop, just type a slash anywhere on the page and scroll down to the section labeled “Templates.” Alternatively, you can start typing the name of the template you're looking for in the search bar that pops up after the slash. You’ll find six built-in options that—at least in my experience—cover most typical use cases for project and team work. These include task list, voting table, progress tracker, Kanban board, team retrospective, and Q&A session. Each one is designed with a specific collaboration scenario in mind, so you don’t have to start from scratch every time you need to gather input or make a decision.

Let’s say you want to collect ideas from your team and quickly gauge opinions. The voting table template is perfect for that. It automatically sets up a clean table with space for listing ideas, a column for pros and cons, and individual voting columns for each team member. Everything updates live as people cast their votes. I use this all the time when we’re deciding between project options, brainstorming campaign themes, or selecting workshop topics.

Another go-to for me is the progress tracker. It’s great for outlining tasks or milestones and assigning a status—like not started, in progress, or completed. You can also add an owner column to show who’s responsible for what. It gives everyone a clear overview and removes the need for back-and-forth updates, since the status can be changed directly in the table.

Now here’s what makes templates even more powerful—you can fully customize them. Once a template is inserted, you can rename the columns, change field types, remove what you don’t need, and tweak the formatting so it fits your workflow. Think of templates as a launchpad. You get a useful structure from the start, but you’re free to shape it however you like.

If you’re working on a shared page, anyone in the workspace can jump in and start editing the template. But you can also take it a step further and turn the entire template into a Loop component, which makes it even more versatile. Just click the six-dot handle to the left of the template and select Create Loop component. Once it’s turned into a component, you’ll see the familiar icon menu appear in the top right. Click the middle icon to copy the component link, and then you can paste it into other tools like Teams or Outlook. From there, your team can collaborate on the same content—even if they’re not in Loop.

Something else I’ve been using more and more is creating my own templates. If you notice you’re building similar structures again and again—whether it's a planning layout, a decision tracker, or a recurring meeting agenda—you can simply build the structure once and then reuse it. Just duplicate the page or copy the section into another one. It’s not a formal “save as template” feature yet, but it works seamlessly and saves a ton of time.
