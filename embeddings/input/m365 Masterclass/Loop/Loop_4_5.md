# Share Easily: Export Loop Content
Now, let’s look at how you can easily export Loop content—so you can share it with others, archive it, or reuse it outside of your Loop workspace.

Up to now, we’ve focused on creating, collaborating, and staying organized inside Loop. But sometimes, you need to share what you’ve created with someone who’s not part of your workspace—or move your content into a different format. Whether it’s for a client who doesn’t use Microsoft 365, a manager who needs a PDF summary, or just for record-keeping, knowing how to export your content properly can save you a lot of time and formatting frustration.

Let’s start with the most straightforward export option. If you want to save an entire page as a PDF, just open the page and click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner. In that menu, you’ll find the option labeled Print and PDF export. Clicking it opens your print settings, where you can make adjustments if needed. Once confirmed, a second popup lets you choose where to save the file. After selecting the location, Loop will save the page as a PDF. This is a useful option when you want to share a static version of your content with someone outside your workspace—like a stakeholder who just needs to read the final outcome or a client who wants a summary file.

Another great export feature Loop offers is the ability to download certain content blocks as Excel files. This works especially well with structured components like team retrospectives, voting tables, progress trackers, Kanban boards, and regular tables. Just hover over the component, click the six-dot menu to the left of the table (not the content block title), and choose Export to Excel from the dropdown. Depending on the size of the table, it might take a few seconds.

Once the export is ready, a popup will appear giving you the option to open the file directly in Excel online. From there, if you prefer working in the desktop version, just click the “Editing” button in the top-right corner and select Open in Desktop App. This works really well when you want to perform deeper analysis, apply formulas, or prepare data for formal reporting outside of Loop.

Just a quick tip—if you're having trouble finding the six-dot menu next to your table, try clicking once inside the table first. That should make the handle appear so you can access the export options.

Now, if you're not looking for a formal export and just want to move content quickly into another tool like Word or PowerPoint, good old copy and paste also works. Simply select the text or components you want, copy them, and paste them into your destination file. Just be aware that some formatting may get lost in translation—especially for more complex layouts or components. So depending on where you're pasting it, you might need to do a bit of cleanup.

Personally, I don’t often need to export content from Loop. I usually try to keep the collaboration happening inside Loop, where everything stays live and in sync. If someone outside the team needs access, I prefer sharing a page or a component link—or using Word or Excel from the start if I know they’ll need editable documents in a more traditional format.
