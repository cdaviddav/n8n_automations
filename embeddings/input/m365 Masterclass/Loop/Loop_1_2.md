# Choose the Right Tool: OneNote or Loop?
Before diving into the content, you might be wondering about the differences between Microsoft Loop and OneNote —and which one fits your needs best. Microsoft offers several powerful note-taking and collaboration tools, and it can easily become confusing. Let's clarify the differences together to ensure you're choosing the right tool.

First, let’s talk about Microsoft Loop, the next-generation collaboration tool that redefines teamwork. Unlike the OneNote family, Loop focuses on shared workspaces, enabling real-time co-authoring, brainstorming, and progress tracking. It’s perfect for dynamic projects that require adaptability and constant collaboration. Microsoft Loop integrates deeply with Microsoft 365, making it a powerful choice for team-based workflows. Access to Loop is available to users with a Microsoft 365 subscription.

Second, let’s discuss Microsoft OneNote, formerly known as OneNote 2016. This is the desktop version of OneNote that runs on all supported versions of Windows. It was previously included with Office 2016 and is now part of Office 2019 and all Microsoft 365 subscriptions. OneNote is the ultimate digital notebook, offering features like multi-section notebooks, multimedia embedding, handwritten notes, and local notebook storage on your PC’s hard drive. It also boasts a full Office ribbon interface and extensive customization options, making it ideal for users who prefer working offline or need advanced functionality. If you're subscribed to Office 2019 or Microsoft 365, you already have access to OneNote. It is also available as a free standalone download for everyone.

So, which one is right for you? If you require sophisticated note-taking functionalities, prefer the ability to work offline, and typically work independently, OneNote is the perfect choice for you. And if collaboration and teamwork are at the heart of your projects, Microsoft Loop is the perfect solution.
