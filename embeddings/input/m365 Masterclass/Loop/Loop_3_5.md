# Stay Organized: Best Practices for Loop
In this video, let’s talk about staying organized in Loop—because even the best tools can become overwhelming if you don’t have a simple system in place.

By now, you know how to create content, use components, link pages, and collaborate with others. But Loop is meant to grow with your work—and as your work expands, your setup needs to stay clear and usable. In this video, I’ll walk you through some of my best practices for keeping things structured, searchable, and easy to navigate—without adding too much overhead.

Let’s start with something really simple: editing text. It might sound basic, but in Loop, it’s important to understand the different ways you can interact with text—and how each option serves a slightly different purpose.

The first way is through the six-dot menu on the left of any text block or section. When you click it, a small popup appears with several options. You can react with emojis, add a comment, turn the block into a Loop component, copy a page link to that section, move the block, or delete it. This menu is especially helpful for collaborating with others—leaving feedback, assigning tasks, or quickly linking to specific parts of the page.

The second way is more about formatting and customization. When you highlight a piece of text, a small formatting bar appears just above it. This lets you bold, italicize, or underline text, change heading levels, and access more advanced options by clicking the three dots. In this extended menu, you’ll find actions like cut, copy, paste, spell check, and more.

There are also two useful dropdowns: one for Headings and Lists, where you can change the selected text into a different heading or list format, and another for Color and Formatting, where you can add text colors or highlights. These give you a lot of flexibility without needing to break your flow.

Next, let’s talk about labels. In my opinion, labels are seriously underrated in Loop. They’re a great way to visually flag information so it stands out at a glance—whether it’s a priority level, a status, or a custom tag.

To insert a label, just type a slash and then “label.” You’ll see a set of pre-defined options, like “Priority Low.” Select one, and a label will appear right in your content—blue by default. From there, you can click on it to edit the label, change the color, or create new custom options. You can use labels in text blocks, tables, or even inside components. They’re super flexible and surprisingly powerful when used consistently.

Now let’s move on to organizing components. As your pages grow, it’s easy for things to get messy. Loop gives you a couple of ways to move things around. You can drag and drop components by grabbing the six-dot handle on the left and placing them wherever you want. Or, for more precise moves, click the six-dot menu and select Move block, then choose whether to move it up or down. It sounds simple, but once you’re managing multiple task lists, meeting notes, and content blocks, this becomes a key part of keeping your page clean and functional.

Next up is a big one—navigation. If you often find yourself jumping between pages, it’s a good idea to create a home page for each workspace. This can be a simple page with links to your most important documents—planning pages, meeting notes, templates, deliverables, and so on. You can insert page links by typing the @ symbol and selecting the page, or by using the slash command and choosing page link.

For individual pages that get long, consider inserting a table of contents. Just type slash and select Table of contents. Loop will insert a dynamic list of all your headings on that page. It updates automatically as you add or remove sections, making it easy for you—and your collaborators—to jump straight to what they’re looking for.

Now let’s talk about folder structures and naming conventions. Loop doesn’t use traditional folders, but you can still keep things organized by using consistent, clear naming. For example, if you’re storing all your meeting notes in one workspace, name each page something like “Client A – 03/15/25” or “Client B – 09/11/26.” That way, they stay grouped together in the sidebar and are easy to scan by date.

If you have a workspace dedicated to a specific client, you can use more descriptive titles like “Weekly Check-In – 06/14/25” or “Q2 Strategy Meeting – 04/01/25.” Whatever naming style you choose, the key is to stay consistent—so you and your team always know where to find things.
