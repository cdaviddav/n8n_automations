# Link Smarter: Connect Pages & Workspaces
Next up, let’s look at how to link pages and workspaces in Loop—so your content stays connected and easy to navigate.

As your Loop setup grows, you’ll want a way to tie things together. Otherwise, you end up with a bunch of disconnected notes and pages that are hard to trace back to their bigger purpose. That’s where linking becomes really useful. And even better, its super easy and intuitive to use.

Let’s start with linking pages—because there are a few different ways to do it, depending on what you need.

The first and fastest way is to simply type @ anywhere on your page. Start typing the name of the page you want to link to, and Loop will bring up matching results. Once you see the one you need, hit Enter, and the link is inserted right into your text. Super quick and especially useful when you're referencing related content on the fly.

The second option is to go to the sidebar, hover over the page you want to link to, and click the three-dot menu—or just right-click the page. Then choose Copy page link. You can paste this link anywhere in your page, and it will act as a direct link to that content.

The third option is a bit more advanced. If you want to embed a full page as a Loop component, you can choose Share as Loop component instead. This turns the entire page into an interactive component that can be pasted into another page—or even shared outside of Loop in tools like Teams or Outlook. Just keep in mind the difference here: linking to a page simply adds a clickable reference, while sharing as a component allows others to interact with the full content in real time and keep it in sync. So when you share the link to an entire page, it will open directly in the recipient’s Loop app. In contrast, when you share a Loop page as a component, you can embed it directly into other tools—like Teams or Outlook—allowing others to view and edit the content without leaving those apps.

I personally use page linking a lot when working on multi-layered projects. For example, I’ll have a top-level project overview page, and under that, several supporting pages—like planning, notes, feedback, and action items. Instead of having to jump back and forth through the navigation bar, I just link the key pages directly so I can move between them easily.

Now let’s talk about linking to a specific section or component within a page. This is one of my favorite features when I want to draw someone’s attention to a particular spot. Just click the six-dot handle next to the block or component, then select Copy page link to here. When someone clicks that link, it opens the full page—but scrolls directly to the component you linked. It’s perfect when you're sharing a task list, a decision log, or anything you need someone to take a look at without scrolling.

Next up: linking workspaces. You can’t embed one workspace into another, but you can easily share or link to a workspace from within any page. To do that, open the workspace and click the Share button in the top-right corner. If you want to invite people to the entire workspace, select the first option. You’ll get a popup where you can enter names or email addresses. Once you hit Invite, they’ll be granted access and notified automatically.

If you just want to grab the link, you’ll also see an option to Copy link. That saves the workspace link to your clipboard, so you can paste it into any page, email, or chat. It’s a nice way to create a sort of dashboard or index page that links out to all the major workspaces you're involved in.

And just as a reminder: under the Share menu, you’ll also find the two familiar options we talked about earlier—to copy a page link, or to share the page as a Loop component.

What I really love about Loop is that you can link to content at almost any level—from entire workspaces, to full pages, to specific components or even individual content blocks. It’s flexible, intuitive, and lets you build a connected system that actually reflects how your work fits together.
