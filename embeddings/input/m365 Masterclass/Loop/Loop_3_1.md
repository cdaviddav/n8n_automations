# Create Quickly: Use Slash Commands
First of all, let’s look at the fastest and most flexible way to create content in Loop—using slash commands.

Now that you know how to navigate Loop, organize your workspaces, and find your content quickly, it’s time to start creating. But if you’re still reaching for the mouse every time you want to add something, you’re missing out. The slash command is one of the simplest, most powerful tricks in Loop—it speeds up your workflow and keeps your hands on the keyboard so you can stay in the flow.

Here’s how it works. Whenever you’re typing in a Loop page, just hit the slash key. That’s the one that looks like a slash leaning forwards. As soon as you type it, a dropdown menu will appear with a list of content blocks you can add.

More specifically, when you type the backslash, you’ll see a wide variety of content blocks you can add—organized across different types. At the top, you’ll find general blocks like tables, checklists, dates, math equations, and even a table of contents. If you scroll down a bit, you’ll see text styles, like paragraph formatting and different heading levels. Below that, there are template-style blocks such as voting tables, progress trackers, and more.

Keep scrolling and you’ll find communication blocks—for example, you can add a person tag or a label. Then there’s the media section, where you can insert images or videos directly into your page. And finally, at the very bottom, you’ll see options to add blocks that pull in content from other Microsoft apps or third-party tools.

I recommend scrolling through the full menu at least once to get a sense of everything that’s available—you might discover something new. That said, in my day-to-day work, I rarely scroll. What I usually do is just start typing the name of the block I want right after the slash. For example, if I type “heading,” it’ll narrow down the list to all the heading styles. You can keep typing until there’s only one option left, or use the arrow keys to jump down to the block you want, then hit Enter to insert it.

As far as I know, there’s no other way to access these content blocks in Loop—everything goes through the slash command. At first, this might feel unfamiliar, especially if you’re used to apps with visible toolbars and buttons. But honestly, it becomes second nature very quickly.

I personally love how Loop is built around this system. It’s fast, intuitive, and feels almost like a mini search tool. If you’re ever unsure whether a certain block exists, just type its name after the slash—if it pops up, great. If not, you’ll know right away and can try something else.

The more you use it, the more natural it becomes. And once it clicks, you’ll be creating pages in Loop much faster than in most traditional tools.
