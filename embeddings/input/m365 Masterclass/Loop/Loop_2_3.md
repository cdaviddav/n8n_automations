# Choose Wisely: Personal, Individual vs. Shared Workspaces
Let’s continue by looking at one of the most important decisions you’ll make when working in Loop—whether to use a personal, individual or a shared workspace.

When you’re just starting out, it’s easy to default to putting everything in one place. But choosing the right type of workspace from the beginning can make a big difference in how organized, collaborative, and secure your setup becomes over time. That’s why it’s worth taking a closer look at the different use cases for personal, individual versus shared workspaces.

So, let’s start with your personal workspace. In fact, there’s only one—and it’s called My Workspace. This workspace is created by default when you start using Loop, and it’s completely private. No one else can see it, and you can’t share the entire workspace with others. You can, however, share individual pages or components from within it, but the workspace as a whole always stays personal.

I personally use My Workspace for anything that’s completely private and unlikely to ever be shared—things like CV updates, personal development notes, or HR-related information. It’s essentially your own sandbox—safe, simple, and just for you.

Now, how do you recognize which workspace is personal? First, My Workspace has its own dedicated spot in the sidebar and is marked with the sunglasses emoji. But you can also see workspace types in the Workspaces section. When you click on Workspaces, you’ll get a second sidebar that lists them. If a workspace is personal, it will say Personal below the name, and a small lock icon will appear. You’ll also see this in the Home dashboard: when you return to the grid view by clicking the Loop icon in the top-left corner, personal workspaces are clearly marked with a lock and a “Personal” label on the top-left corner of the workspace card.

Now let’s talk about what I call individual workspaces. These are workspaces you create yourself, and by default, they’re private—only you can access them. But unlike My Workspace, these can be shared. You can add other members at any time, and the moment you do, that workspace becomes a shared workspace. Until then, no one else can see or edit the content.

To check whether a workspace is still private (meaning only you have access), just open the workspace. In the second sidebar at the top, next to the workspace name, you’ll see a small people icon with a plus sign. The number next to it tells you how many people have access. If it’s just one, that means it’s still private. If there are more, then it’s already shared with others.

When you create a new workspace, it’s private by default. It only becomes shared once you actively invite people to it—and we’ll walk through the sharing process in more detail in a later chapter.

Once you add members, you’ve got yourself a shared workspace, which is where Loop really shines for collaboration. Everyone you invite can view and edit content—unless you specifically adjust the permissions. I usually switch to a shared workspace when I’m working on something that needs input from others, like a client project, a team workshop, or an internal initiative.

Shared workspaces are great for visibility and alignment. Everyone sees the same content, and updates happen in real time. You can even see where your colleagues are currently working within a page. It’s also where features like task assignments, comments, and shared Loop components really come to life. And since those components sync across tools like Teams and Outlook, it’s easy to stay aligned without constantly switching apps.

So how do you decide what type of workspace to create? When you click Create new and select Workspace, Loop will ask whether you want to share it and let you add members right away. If you skip that step, the workspace will remain private for now—but you can always invite others later.

Personally, I like to start small but think ahead. If I know from the beginning that a workspace is meant for a team project, I’ll go ahead and add the other members right away. But if I’m still figuring things out, I’ll keep the workspace private until I’m ready to collaborate.
