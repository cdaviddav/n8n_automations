# Collaborate Live: Use Loop in Teams
First of all, let’s explore how you can collaborate live by using Loop directly inside Microsoft Teams—so your conversations and your content stay connected in one place.

Up to now, we’ve been working inside the Loop app itself—creating pages, sharing components, assigning tasks, and running meetings. But in most teams, a lot of collaboration still happens in Microsoft Teams. That’s where decisions are made, discussions evolve, and action happens. The good news is, you don’t have to jump between tools. You can use Loop content directly within Teams—keeping everything dynamic, editable, and in sync.

When it comes to using Loop inside Teams, there are several ways to set it up. In fact, you have four main options: you can use Loop components directly in conversations, embed full Loop pages or workspaces into chats and channels, access your Loop workspaces through the Loop app in the Teams sidebar, and use Loop components to collaborate on live meeting notes.

Let’s start with the most granular option—Loop components in Teams chats. If you’ve already turned a content block in Loop into a component, just click the copy icon—that’s the middle icon in the top-right corner of the component—to copy the link. Then paste that link directly into any Teams chat or channel using Ctrl + V. As soon as you send the message, the component will appear directly in the chat, along with the link above it. The component is now fully live and interactive. That means anyone in the conversation can edit it in real time, and every update syncs instantly with the original component in your Loop workspace.

Alternatively, you can also create a Loop components directly from within a Teams chat or post. To add a Loop component, simply go to the message box in a chat or channel, click the Loop icon, and pick the type of component you want to insert. Once added, everyone in the chat or channel can jump in and start editing immediately.

Just like with any other Loop component, you’ll see three icons in the top right corner: one to view all shared locations, one to copy the component, and one to check who has access.

Embedding Loop components directly to Teams chats is especially powerful for short checklists, idea collections, voting tables, or meeting follow-ups—basically any content where you want quick, collaborative input without needing to open a separate tool. I use it all the time to keep momentum going during discussions.

Now let’s talk about how you can bring your Loop work into Teams and collaborate seamlessly across both platforms. There are two main ways to do this: embedding a Loop page or workspace into a Teams chat or into a Teams channel—with slightly different steps for each.

Starting with Teams chats, if you want to bring a Loop page or workspace into an ongoing conversation with one or more people, there’s a simple workaround – because at the point of this recording, there is no native way to do that.

First, in Loop, locate the page or workspace you want to share. To get the link for a single page, either right-click the page in the left-hand sidebar and select Copy page link, or open the page, click the Share button at the top right, and select Page link. A pop-up will confirm the link has been copied to your clipboard.

If you want to share an entire workspace, open any page within the workspace, click the Share button, select Workspace, and then Copy link.

Once you have the link, switch over to your Teams chat. Click the plus icon at the top to add a new tab. Instead of looking for Loop directly, select Website as the tab type.
Paste your copied Loop link into the URL field, give the tab a name, and click Save. Now, the Loop page or workspace will appear as a new tab in the chat—and when you click it, it will open the live version directly in your browser, ready for everyone to collaborate on.

Now, if you’re working in a Teams channel, integrating Loop becomes even easier, because here, there is a native Loop integration!

Inside the channel, click the plus icon at the top of the screen to add a new tab. This time, you’ll find Loop listed directly as an app. Select Loop, click Save, and you’ll have the option to either create a new workspace or add content before setting it up. If you create a new workspace, simply give it a name and click Create. If you choose to add content, you can pull in existing Loop pages, components, or files before launching the workspace.

Once created, the workspace will appear right inside the channel, with your pages listed on the left-hand side. You can start building from there—adding new pages, using templates, inserting tables, task lists, and more, exactly as you would in the Loop app.

And just like with anything created in Loop, your workspace remains fully synced. Whether you open it from Teams, directly in the Loop app, or through your browser, you’re always working on the latest live version—keeping your collaboration seamless across platforms. Also note that your workspace will, just as any other workspace, appear in your Loop sidebar just as the content you have been adding.

Let’s talk about the third option: using Loop as a full app within Teams. This is great if you want access to all your Loop workspaces without leaving the Teams environment. It’s especially useful if Loop is where you do most of your planning, project tracking, or shared documentation.

To get started, click the three-dot menu in the left-hand Teams sidebar, search for Loop, and open it. If you plan to use it often, right-click the icon and choose Pin so it stays easily accessible. When you open Loop inside Teams, you’ll see a familiar interface: your personal workspaces at the top, followed by a list of your components below. You can also filter for meeting notes, favorites, or search by keyword.

Clicking on any item will open it in your browser, just like in the Loop app. It’s not a separate version—it’s simply a convenient way to access all your Loop content without switching windows.

Finally, let’s take a look at the fourth option: using Loop for meeting notes in Teams. To be honest, this feature is a bit hidden—but it’s absolutely worth exploring, because it can completely change how you manage meeting notes going forward.

To get started, schedule a meeting in Teams just like you normally would. Go to your Teams calendar, either double-click a time slot or click New Meeting in the top-right corner. Fill out the usual details—title, required attendees, time, location, and any message you want to include. Nothing new so far.

Now here’s the important part. At the very bottom of the meeting invite, you’ll see a small option that says “Add an agenda.” When you click it, Loop steps in and automatically creates a structured component with three sections: Agenda, Meeting Notes, and Follow-up Tasks.

This component is embedded directly into the invite. You can start filling out the agenda before sending the invite, so everyone receives it with context right from the beginning. Once you click Send, the invite goes out to all attendees—with the Loop component included. And even after the invite is sent, you can come back and update it. Just reopen the meeting from your Teams calendar, scroll to the bottom, and edit the content in the Loop component as needed.

A quick heads-up: this feature only works when you schedule or edit meetings via Teams. If you open the invite from your Outlook calendar, the Loop component won’t be visible—which can be a bit confusing. So if you want to use this feature, always open the invite from the Teams calendar.

Now, when it’s time for the meeting, and you join through either Teams or Outlook, you’ll see the familiar Teams meeting interface. What you want to do is click the Notes tab at the top. This opens the embedded Loop component in a side panel on the right. You’ll see the agenda you prepared, along with editable sections for meeting notes and follow-up tasks. And because it’s a Loop component, everyone in the meeting can contribute live. You can add talking points, capture decisions, assign action items—all in real time, together.

Even better, you can add more than just text. Just type a slash and insert tables, checklists, or any other content block—just like you would on a regular Loop page. It’s a fully dynamic and collaborative space.

If you click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the component, you’ll see more options—like copying the component link, checking access permissions, seeing where it’s been shared, or opening it directly in the Loop app.

After the meeting ends, the notes don’t disappear. In fact, you have a few easy ways to access them again. You can reopen the meeting in your Teams calendar and scroll down to the Loop component. Or, you can copy the component into another Loop page if you want to reuse or store it elsewhere. And finally, you can open the Loop app, click on Meeting Notes in the left-hand sidebar, and browse a list of all meeting notes connected to your calendar.

This feature has become one of my personal favorites, especially for recurring meetings or team syncs. It keeps everything in one place, makes collaboration easier, and removes the pain of sending separate meeting summaries afterward.
