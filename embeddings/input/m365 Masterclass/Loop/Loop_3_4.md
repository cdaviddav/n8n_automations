# Save Time: Use & Create Page Templates
Now, let’s look at how you can save time and bring consistency to your work by using and creating page templates in Loop.

By now, you’ve seen how powerful Loop can be when it comes to creating flexible and linked notes and content blocks. But if you’re setting up similar pages again and again—like for meetings, projects, or recurring tasks—starting from scratch every time is just not efficient. That’s where templates come in.

Let’s start with the basics. When you create a new page in Loop, you’ll notice there’s an option to choose from a few built-in templates. Just click Create page, and instead of starting from a blank slate, scroll to the bottom of the new page where you’ll see some suggested templates—like a project brief, meeting notes, or a project planner.

Below those suggestions, you’ll also see a small icon labeled Template gallery. If you click on it, a popup will open with a much larger selection of page templates. I recommend scrolling through the gallery at least once so you’re aware of what’s available—it can give you a great head start and some inspiration for structuring your own content.

What I really like is that these templates come pre-filled with helpful structure—headings, content blocks, and sometimes even checklists or tables. And the best part is that they’re fully customizable. I often insert a template that looks close to what I need, and then I just tweak it—delete what’s not relevant, add what’s missing, and reshape the content to match my workflow.

That said, the built-in templates are still somewhat limited, and they might not always match your specific needs. That’s why I rely more on creating my own page templates. The idea is simple: instead of building the same layout from scratch over and over again, just create a page once exactly the way you want it—with all the right sections, formatting, and components—and reuse it whenever needed.

There are two easy ways to do this. First, you can duplicate an existing page. Just open the three-dot menu next to the page name in the sidebar and click Duplicate. A full copy of the page will appear right below the original. This is especially useful when you're working with recurring formats—like client briefings, project outlines, or weekly meeting notes.

The second option is to start with a built-in template that’s close to what you want and simply adjust it—trim what you don’t need, add your own content, and use that as your base going forward.

Now, here’s something to keep in mind: Loop doesn’t currently allow you to officially save a page as a “template” that appears in the template gallery. So instead, you’ll need to keep your custom templates stored in your workspace. What I do is place them at the bottom of the page list in the sidebar, clearly labeled as templates. Or, if you use a lot of custom templates, you might even want to set up a separate workspace just for storing them. That way, you always have quick access and can duplicate them anytime.

Personally, I use this approach all the time. For example, I have a reusable layout for team meetings that includes a structured agenda, note sections, and a checklist for follow-ups. I built it once, and now anytime I schedule a new meeting, I just duplicate that page, update the title and date, and I’m good to go in under a minute. It’s consistent, saves time, and gives my teammates a familiar format to work with.
