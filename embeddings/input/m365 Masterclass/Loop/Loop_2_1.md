# Navigate Easily: Master Loop’s Interface
If you’re new to Loop, the interface might feel a bit unfamiliar at first. Even if you’re used to working with other Microsoft 365 apps, Loop can still seem quite different—the layout, the terminology, and even the way you interact with content all break away from the typical Microsoft feel. That was definitely my impression the first time I opened it.

But don’t worry—Loop is an incredibly powerful tool once you get the hang of it. It’s designed to help you work more seamlessly and collaborate more flexibly, especially in team settings where quick updates and smooth workflows really matter. So let’s explore Loop together and make it work for you.

But before we dive in, one quick heads-up: everything I walk you through in this and the following chapters applies to the version of Loop that’s part of a Microsoft 365 subscription. You can use Loop without a subscription, but the interface might look slightly different. Most features will still be there, but you’ll miss out on some of the deeper integrations with the rest of the Microsoft 365 environment.

So, when you first open Loop, you’ll land in the My Workspace view. Think of it as your personal dashboard. This is where you’ll find your own notes and an overview of all your workspaces—both personal and shared—displayed as cards. It’s your starting point every time you return to Loop.

In the My Workspace view, there’s also a helpful tab that shows your recent pages and components, making it easy to jump back into whatever you were last working on. If you prefer a more compact layout, you can switch from the card grid to a list view by clicking the icon with the horizontal lines in the top-right corner. And if you want to quickly see only your favorites, just click the star icon to filter them.

By the way, if you ever want to return to this exact view, just click the Loop icon in the top-left corner—it’ll take you straight back here.

So now you know where Loop always starts. Let’s move on to the navigation pane on the left-hand side.

At the very top, you’ll see the Create new button. What this button does depends on where you are in Loop. If you’re in the home view, clicking it will let you create a new workspace. But if you’re already inside a workspace, the options expand—you’ll be able to create a new page, add an existing page, add a component or link, upload a file, or even create another workspace. I like that this button adapts to context—it makes the interface feel clean without limiting your options.

Just below the Create new button, there’s a small icon that lets you collapse or expand the left-hand navigation. Click once, it disappears. Click again, it reappears. Simple.

Next comes Search, which is surprisingly powerful. It doesn’t just search page titles—it also looks through the content inside your pages and components. Personally, I use this all the time. If I can remember a phrase or keyword but not where I wrote it, Search usually gets me there instantly.

Below that, you’ll see Notifications. These are split into "All" and "Unread," and they’re super helpful for keeping track of collaboration. For example, you’ll get notified if someone tags you, assigns you a task, comments on your work, or invites you to a workspace. When you click on a notification, Loop opens the relevant page or component on the right so you can see exactly what it’s referring to.

After notifications, there’s the Recent tab. This shows all your recent activity—not just pages and components from Loop, but also those edited in other apps like Teams. So if someone dropped a Loop component into a Teams chat and updated it there, it’ll still show up here.

Then comes Meeting Notes. This is one of my favorite parts: it pulls in all meeting notes linked to Outlook or Teams meetings, so you don’t have to hunt them down manually. It’s all in one place, and only meeting-linked notes are shown here—so it stays focused and relevant.

Below that, you’ll see the list of your Workspaces. Each one is like a dedicated hub for a project or topic. Click on any workspace to open it and access all the related pages and components. You can collapse or expand each workspace section to keep your sidebar neat and easy to manage.

Right below your workspaces, you’ll again find My Workspace—your personal space—and beneath that, a list of recent workspaces you’ve accessed.

Now, let’s look at the top-right corner of the interface. In most views, you’ll see a few general-purpose buttons. On the lower line, there are three dots (the "More options" menu). This is where you’ll find page settings—things like renaming, deleting, or adjusting the style of a page.

Next to those dots, you’ve got quick actions: you can share the page, copy it as a Loop component, or see where it’s been shared. We’ll explore those collaboration tools in detail in a later chapter, so don’t worry if that feels like a lot right now.

Above that row of icons, in the very top right, you’ll see your profile picture or initials. Clicking here gives you the option to sign out. If you want to access settings, click the gear icon next to your profile. Here you can make a few useful changes—like switching between dark and light mode, adjusting your language preferences, or enabling text predictions. I personally appreciate the dark mode, especially when working in the evenings.
