# Track Tasks: Sync Loop with Planner & To Do
Now, let’s explore how Loop connects with Microsoft Planner and To Do—so the tasks you assign during meetings or planning sessions don’t just sit in notes, but actually show up where people manage their day.

One of the most common frustrations in team collaboration is this: you agree on next steps, write them down, and then… nothing happens. Tasks get lost in meeting notes, people forget who’s doing what, and it takes too much effort to track everything manually. That’s where Loop’s task integration with Planner and To Do makes a real difference. Once a task is assigned in Loop, it automatically syncs to each person’s task management tools—without needing to copy anything over.

Let’s start inside a Loop page. The easiest way to assign tasks is by inserting a Task List component. Just type a slash and select Task List from the menu. A table will appear with built-in columns for naming the task, assigning someone, setting a due date, and categorizing it with a bucket. As soon as you assign a task by entering a colleague’s name in the Assigned to column, Loop will automatically notify them and sync the task to their Microsoft To Do—as long as they’re part of your organization. That’s important: only people within your organization can be assigned and tracked this way.

Once assigned, the task shows up in the person’s To Do under Assigned to me, and it may also appear under My Day or Planned, depending on whether a due date has been set. If the assignee opens the task in To Do, they’ll see a link back to the original Loop page where the task list lives—so they can always trace it to its context. They can also organize the task further by dragging it into one of their personal To Do lists.

What’s great is that Microsoft’s task ecosystem syncs seamlessly across tools. So not only does the task appear in To Do, it also shows up in Planner—under My Tasks and My Day, again depending on the deadline. And just like in Loop, any updates—like completing the task or adjusting the due date—are reflected instantly across all apps. Everything stays in sync, automatically.

This is incredibly helpful for maintaining momentum after meetings. You don’t have to follow up separately or rebuild task lists in other tools. If someone already manages their work in Planner or To Do, your assignments from Loop will simply appear in their existing flow.

Now if you prefer a more visual layout, Loop also offers Progress Trackers and Kanban boards via templates. These work similarly—you can assign tasks by clicking in the Assignee column and selecting someone from your team. The tasks created in these views sync just like those in the Task List.

There are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, for the task syncing to work, the person must be in your organization and have access to the workspace or page where the task lives. If you assign a task to someone outside your org, it won’t appear in their To Do or Planner. Also, for everything to run smoothly, your teammates need to actively use Microsoft 365’s task tools—otherwise, it’s still worth nudging them directly.

Now, let’s take the integration between Loop and Planner to the next level. Unfortunately, this part doesn’t apply to To Do directly, but since Planner and To Do are connected, changes in one will still flow through to the other. In Loop, type /Planner and you’ll see the Planner icon appear—this allows you to embed a full Planner plan directly onto your Loop page.

When you select Planner, a pop-up will give you two options: select from your pinned plans or from your recent plans. Keep in mind that these need to be actual Planner plans—not task lists originally created in To Do that appear in Planner. Once you choose a plan and click Insert, Loop will add it to the page as a live component.

From there, you’ll see exactly what you’d see in Planner. You can view tasks grouped by buckets, use filters, add members, and manage tasks right from Loop. And just like any other Loop component, you can copy it via the component menu and paste it into Teams or Outlook for wider collaboration. Everyone with access can view and edit the plan from wherever they are.

Personally, I love using this feature for project dashboards. I can embed the actual Planner view in a Loop workspace where we’re writing meeting notes or planning deliverables. It keeps everything in one place—discussion, decisions, and tasks—without jumping between apps.
