# Build Efficiently: Add & Organize Components
Now let’s take things a step further and look at how to build your pages more efficiently by using and organizing components in Loop.
In this video, we’ll focus on how to make your pages truly work for you. Components are one of Loop’s most powerful features—used well, they can turn a basic page into a dynamic, interactive workspace. But without the right structure, things can quickly get messy. That’s why we’ll go over how to add components effectively and keep your pages clear, organized, and easy to work with.

Let’s start with the basics. A component in Loop is a block of content that lives on a page, but can also be shared across other tools—like Teams or Outlook—and always stays in sync. You can create task lists, tables, checklists, voting tables, and more. In fact, pretty much any content block in Loop can be turned into a component.

To do this, simply click on the block or paragraph you want to convert. You can also select multiple items—like a group of bullet points or several blocks at once. Once selected, click the six-dot handle on the left side of the block to open a small popup menu. Then choose Create Loop Component.

As soon as you do that, the selected content will be turned into a component. You’ll know it’s a component because it gets a subtle purple-blue border around it, and the label at the top will say “Component” or show the name if you’ve already renamed it. This visual cue makes it easy to see which parts of your page are components and helps them stand out from the rest of your content.

What makes components so powerful is that they’re live. That means if you copy and paste a component into a Teams chat or an Outlook email, anyone can edit it there, and the changes will automatically update on the original Loop page too. This is especially useful when you're working with others and want to avoid version chaos.

Once you’ve added a few components, the key is to keep things clean and organized. For example, I usually start my pages with a short intro or context paragraph before I drop in a component. That helps anyone coming to the page understand what they’re looking at. I also like to use headings to separate different sections—like tasks, meeting notes, or feedback—so everything is easy to scan.

I also recommend clearly labeling your components—especially if you’re sharing them with others. For example, if you’re using a simple text block or a task list, add a heading or a short intro right at the top. That way, whoever receives the component—whether in Teams or Outlook—knows exactly what it’s about and what’s expected from them. Otherwise, it can be a bit confusing to just see a random text field without any context.

Now, when it comes to organizing your page, Loop makes it super easy to move components around. Just grab the six-dot handle on the left side of the component and drag it wherever you want. This is something I do all the time during planning sessions—moving key action items to the top, pushing reference content down, or reordering things as my thoughts develop. It’s quick, flexible, and keeps the page layout aligned with your workflow.

Once your components are organized, you might want to share them—and Loop makes that just as easy. Every component has a small menu in the top right with three icons.

The rightmost icon shows a people icon. Clicking on it will show you who currently has access to that component and what permissions they have.

The middle icon, with the two overlapping squares, is the copy button. Click on it, and a small popup will confirm that the component link has been copied to your clipboard. From there, you can paste it into Teams, Outlook, or anywhere else you want. The popup also lets you adjust link settings by clicking Settings. This is where you can choose how the component is shared.

There are three main options for sharing: First, you can allow anyone in your organization to edit it.
Second, you can limit access to people who already have permission.
And third, you can share it with specific people, including those outside your organization.

Below that, you can decide whether people can edit the component or only view it. That said, I personally think view-only doesn’t make much sense for Loop. The real power of Loop components is in real-time collaboration—so editing access is usually the way to go.

At the very bottom, there’s also an option to set an expiration date for the link. This can be useful if you want to limit how long people can make changes. If you don’t set one, the component will remain active indefinitely.

The last icon, with four small dots, shows the shared locations of that component. It tells you exactly where the component has already been shared—like in which Teams chat, email, or Loop page. This is especially helpful if you’ve shared the same component in multiple places and want to keep track of it.

Now, once you’ve copied the link and pasted it into, let’s say, a Teams chat, anyone with access will be able to edit the component directly from there. And the best part? All edits sync live—so whatever they update in Teams will immediately appear back on your Loop page.

One more tip: if you want to direct someone to a specific component on a page, you can copy a link to that exact spot. To do that, click the six-dot handle on the left of the component and select Copy page link to here. When you send that link, the person will land directly on the page—with the view jumping straight to the component. This is super helpful if you want to share the full page, but still highlight the one area where someone needs to provide input or take action.
