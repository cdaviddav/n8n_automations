# Share Securely: Control Permissions
First of all, let’s talk about how to share your content securely in Loop—and how to control exactly who can see and edit what.

Before you start sharing content across your team or organization, it’s important to understand how permissions work in Loop. Because while sharing can be simple, it’s just as easy to accidentally give access to the wrong person or to lose control over who can change what.

Let’s start with the basics. When you create a new workspace in Loop, it’s individual by default—which means only you can see or edit it. But Loop gives you a few different ways to share it, depending on when and how you want to bring others in.

The first option is to add collaborators right when you create the workspace. When the popup appears during creation, just type in the names or email addresses of the people you want to invite in the Share your space field. Once you’ve added everyone and click Create, they’ll be added as members from the start and immediately gain access to everything inside.

If you decide to share the workspace later, open the workspace and click the Share button in the top-right corner. In the dropdown, choose Workspace. A popup will appear where you can invite people by name or email, just like during creation. Once added, they’ll be notified and have access to all pages within that workspace.

Below the invitation field, you’ll also find the link sharing option. Click Copy link, and you’ll get a direct link to the workspace you can send to others.

Now let’s move on to pages and components, which can be shared independently—even if the workspace itself hasn’t been shared. For any individual page, you can click the three-dot menu in the sidebar or use the share button at the top right of the page. Select Share page link, and a popup will appear confirming that the link has been copied to your clipboard.

From there, click Link settings to adjust who can access the page. You’ll see three main options: First, allow anyone in your organization to edit the page. Second, limit access to people who already have permission. Third, share the page with specific individuals, including those outside your organization.

Below that, you can choose whether people can edit or view only. Personally, I don’t find view-only that helpful in most Loop scenarios, because the whole point of using Loop is real-time collaboration—so editing access usually makes more sense. You can also set an expiration date for the link, which limits how long people can access or modify the content. If you don’t set one, the link stays active indefinitely.

Now let’s talk about sharing individual components—like a task list or voting table. Every component has a small menu in the top-right corner with three icons. The middle icon, which looks like two overlapping squares, is the copy link button. Click it, and you’ll get a confirmation popup that the link has been copied to your clipboard. From there, you can paste it into Teams, Outlook, or even another Loop page. It’s quick, simple, and super effective when you want to share just one piece of content.

The popup also includes a Settings button, where you can configure permissions the same way you would for pages. Again, you can choose between sharing with your organization, specific people, or only those who already have access. And you can decide whether collaborators can edit or view the component. Just like with pages, there’s also an option to set an expiration date for the component link.

Once you’ve shared a component, the other two icons on the top-right become useful too.

The rightmost icon, shaped like a person, shows you exactly who has access to the component and what level of permission they have. If you need to adjust or remove someone, that’s where to do it.

The leftmost icon, which looks like four small dots, shows the shared locations of the component. This tells you where else it has been shared—whether it’s in a Teams chat, an Outlook email, or another Loop page. This is especially helpful if you're reusing the same component in multiple places and want to keep track of it.
