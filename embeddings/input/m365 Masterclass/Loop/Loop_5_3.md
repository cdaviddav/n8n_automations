# Update Emails: Link Loop with Outlook
Next up: Let’s take a look at how you can link Loop with Outlook—so you can embed content directly into emails, keep updates live, and avoid endless back-and-forth.

Even though we’ve moved a lot of our work into shared digital spaces, email still plays a huge role—especially when working with clients, external partners, or leadership teams. The problem is that email tends to freeze collaboration. You send a version of something, someone replies with feedback, and before you know it, you’ve got five threads going with ten slightly different versions of the same content. That’s exactly what Loop helps solve.

So, let’s take a look at how you can add a Loop component to an Outlook message. In Outlook, start by opening a new email. At the top, under the Message tab, you’ll see the option to insert a Loop component. When you click on it, a dropdown menu will appear showing all the available content blocks—things like bulleted lists, checklists, numbered lists, paragraphs, and more.

Once you select one, the component is immediately inserted into the body of your email, and you can start filling it out with your content. It looks simple, but here’s the powerful part—it’s not just static text. It’s a live, collaborative element. If the person or people you’re emailing are within your organization, they can edit the component directly from their inbox. Every change they make syncs in real time back to the original component in Loop. No version chaos, no need to send follow-ups—it’s the same content, just updated collaboratively.

If you want to reuse this component or share it somewhere else, you can do that too. Just click the copy icon in the top-right corner of the component in the email, and paste it wherever you want—like in a Teams chat or on another Loop page. It stays fully synced, no matter where you share it.

And yes, you can also include Loop components in Outlook meeting invites, just like you would in a regular email. The only difference is where the button is located—inside a meeting invite, you’ll find it under the Insert tab instead of the Message tab.

Now, you might be wondering: where does the component actually live once you’ve added it to an email? That part is simple—it lives in your personal Loop space and is stored in OneDrive. You can find your Loop components in Loop under Recent pages and components. It’s not tied to a specific workspace or page unless you move it there manually. So if you want to organize it into a project workspace later, you can always copy and paste it into the right place.

Additionally if you search for Loop components, you can find them in in OneDrive under the folders “Attachments”.
