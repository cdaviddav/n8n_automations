# Track Changes: Use Version History
Now, let’s talk about tracking changes in Loop and how to use version history to stay in control—especially when working in shared workspaces.

When you’re collaborating with others, it can sometimes feel a bit risky. What if someone deletes something important by accident? What if an earlier idea gets overwritten? And what if you just want to go back to how a page looked yesterday? That’s exactly where version history in Loop comes in. It’s a simple but powerful way to track changes and restore previous versions when needed—without having to worry about losing work.

To use version history, open the page you want to review. In the top-right corner, click the three-dot menu, and select Version history. This opens a sidebar on the right, showing a timeline of saved versions along with timestamps and the names of people who made changes.

Now here’s the catch: you can’t actually preview the older versions before restoring them. Instead, you’ll see the list, and if you want to go back to a specific version, you need to click Restore version at the bottom of the sidebar. Loop will then ask you to confirm that you want to overwrite the current page. Once you confirm, the page will reload and show the restored version.

In practice, when you choose to restore a previous version of a page, Loop doesn’t overwrite the current one. Instead, it creates a new page containing the older content. That way, you keep both versions—the current page and the restored one—side by side. You can then decide which version to continue working with or copy specific pieces from one to the other, or even combine them into a new page if needed.

Version history works in a very similar way for Loop components—which is a big advantage. When you share a Loop component in Outlook, OneNote, or Teams, that component is also saved as a standalone page in your Loop workspace and will appear in your Recent list. Even though it’s embedded in other apps, it still lives in Loop and behaves like a full page.

When you open the component in Loop you’ll see the familiar three-dot menu in the top-right corner. This means you still have access to options like Version History, just as you would with a regular Loop page. So while it may look like a simple embedded object elsewhere, behind the scenes it’s treated as a full Loop page, including full support for tracking changes and restoring previous versions.

Personally, I really like having version history as a safety net—especially when working with others. It’s reassuring to know that nothing is truly lost. That said, I do wish Loop would let us preview earlier versions before restoring them. But even as it is now, it’s a helpful and reliable feature for collaborative work.
