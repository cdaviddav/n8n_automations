# Sync Notes: Connect Loop with OneNote
Next up: Let’s talk about how to connect Loop with OneNote—so you can bridge your personal notes and your team collaboration without duplicating effort or losing track of ideas.

If you’re anything like me, you probably use OneNote for your personal thinking space—planning, rough ideas, reference notes, or even journaling. It’s flexible, private, and easy to navigate. But when it comes to working with others or turning those ideas into shared action, Loop is often the better place. The challenge is keeping the two connected—so your personal notes don’t drift away from your collaborative work, and your shared content doesn’t get forgotten after a meeting ends. So, let’s see how this can be done.

There are two main ways to connect OneNote with Microsoft Loop. The first—and most interactive—is by embedding Loop components directly into OneNote. If you’ve used Loop before, you’ll be happy to know that these components work natively inside OneNote as well. Just go to the Insert tab and select Loop Component. Once added to a page, the component behaves exactly like it would in Loop: it’s fully live, editable in real time, and can be shared across Outlook, Teams, and other apps.

Since the component has not been created in a Loop page originally, you might be wondering where this component actually lives once you’ve added it to a OneNote page? That part is simple—it lives in your personal Loop space and is stored in OneDrive. You can find your Loop components in Loop under Recent pages and components. As said, it’s not tied to a specific Loop workspace or page unless you move it there manually.

Additionally if you search for Loop components, you can find them in in OneDrive under the folders “Attachments”.

The second major way to connect OneNote and loop is via links. In fact, this is great when you do not only want to share and collaborate on one single component but maybe link entire pages. As you know, every page and component in Loop has a unique URL, so if you want to reference Loop content inside OneNote, just grab the link and paste it into your notebook. You can even add a short line of context above it—like “See shared planning board in Loop”—so it’s clear what it refers to. Clicking that link from OneNote will open the component in the Loop web version.

You can do the same the other way around. If you want to link to OneNote content from within Loop, just grab the page link from OneNote. To do that, right-click on the relevant page in OneNote’s sidebar and select Copy Link to Page. Then paste it into your Loop page where it fits. If you want to link to an entire notebook, click the Share button in the top-right corner of OneNote and choose Copy link to notebook. Once pasted into Loop, anyone with access will be able to open it—so make sure the permissions are set accordingly.

I use these small link-backs often in my projects to bridge the two tools. OneNote is still my go-to for rough ideas and longform personal notes, but Loop is where things get turned into structured, shareable content. Linking between the two helps me stay organized without duplicating effort.
