# Work Together: Real-Time Co-Authoring
Next, let’s look at how real-time co-authoring in Loop makes working with others not just possible, but actually enjoyable.

In the previous video, we covered how to share content securely and set the right permissions. Now it’s time to see what happens once people start collaborating with you. Real-time co-authoring is one of the things that makes Loop so powerful. Instead of waiting for feedback or juggling five different document versions, you and your team can work on the same content, at the same time—and everyone stays on the same page, literally.

As soon as someone else opens the same page you're working on, you'll see their profile picture or initials pop up—both in the sidebar next to the page name and at the top of the Loop window. You'll also see their live cursor on the page, marked with their initials, so you know exactly where they’re editing or typing. This makes it super easy to tell who’s working where and helps you avoid accidentally overwriting someone else’s input. It’s a small detail, but it makes a big difference in creating a smooth, real-time editing experience.

You can also comment and give feedback without interrupting the flow. If someone is drafting text and you want to weigh in, just highlight the section, and a small popup will appear above it. Click the comment icon—it looks like a little speech bubble—and type your feedback right there. The person will be notified, and your comment stays in context on the page.

The great part is that others can reply directly under your comment, so it becomes a mini-thread rather than a scattered collection of feedback. That way, you don’t lose track of what’s been said or who responded.

Inside each comment, you also have additional options. Click the three-dot menu in the top right corner of the comment bubble to edit your message, delete it, copy the full thread, or copy a direct link to the comment. I personally love the “copy link” option—it’s super helpful when you want to point someone straight to a specific question or discussion, especially if they weren’t part of the initial conversation.

And don’t forget—you can @mention people in comments by typing the @ symbol followed by their name. This instantly pulls them into the thread and lets them know their input is needed. But mentions aren’t limited to comments. You can also use @mentions directly in any part of your content. For example, you might tag someone under a heading that says “Review needed” or inside a checklist to assign a task.

Another nice feature is the ability to react to someone’s input. You can’t react to individual words or sentences, but you can react to entire content blocks. Just click the six-dot handle on the left of the block, and choose your emoji—like a thumbs up, a heart, or one of the others. It’s a quick way to acknowledge input without leaving a comment.

One of the best things about Loop is that real-time collaboration isn’t limited to Loop itself. You can share Loop components with others, and they can edit them directly from Teams or Outlook. So even if they never open Loop, they can still contribute—and their updates sync instantly on your original Loop page.

We’ve already talked about how to share Loop components using the copy link option and pasting them into other Microsoft apps. This is where that feature really shines. Everyone works from the same source of truth, no matter which tool they’re using.

That said, collaboration only works well when there’s a bit of structure in place. I always recommend using clear headings, labels, and sections to help others navigate your content. Otherwise, it can get confusing—especially when multiple people are editing at the same time.

And finally, remember that version history is always running quietly in the background. If something gets deleted or changed by mistake, you can go back and restore a previous version of the page. It's your safety net, and honestly, I find it really comforting—especially when working in large teams or fast-moving projects.
