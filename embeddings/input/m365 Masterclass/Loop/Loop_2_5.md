# Find Fast: Search in Loop
Next up, let’s make sure you can always find what you need—fast.

As your Loop workspaces grow, so does the amount of content you’re managing. Pages, components, meeting notes, tasks—it adds up quickly. Without a good search function, it’s easy to lose track of where things are. That’s why in this video, we’ll focus on how to use Loop’s built-in search to stay organized and avoid wasting time digging through endless pages.

You’ll find the Search bar in the left-hand navigation pane, just below the Create new button. When you click on it, Loop will first show a list of your recent pages, followed by the recent workspaces you’ve been working in. But don’t worry—search goes way beyond just recent activity.

What’s great about Loop’s search is that it doesn’t just look at page or workspace titles. It searches everything—all your written content, sections, and even components inside pages. So even if you only remember a phrase or keyword, Loop can usually track it down.

It works just like you’d expect: type your search term, and Loop will instantly filter and display relevant results. The matching words are highlighted in bold, making it easy to spot why something came up. When you click on a result, the corresponding page opens right away, and you can jump straight back into your work.

This is especially helpful when you’re working across multiple workspaces or trying to revisit something you wrote weeks ago. Instead of clicking around and guessing, you can find exactly what you need in seconds.

Personally, I use the search function all the time—especially when I can’t remember where I wrote something but I do remember a few words or phrases. It saves me from scrolling and digging through endless pages.

But let me share one quick note: if you’re used to pressing Ctrl + F to search, Loop does things a bit differently. The shortcut to open Loop’s native search is Ctrl + J. Why? No idea. But now you know it.
