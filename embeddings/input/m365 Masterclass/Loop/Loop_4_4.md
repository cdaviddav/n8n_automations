# Assign Tasks: Streamline Workflows
Next up: Let’s look at how you can assign tasks and streamline your team’s workflows directly inside Loop—without needing a separate task management tool.

When it comes to turning ideas into action, tasks are where things often fall through the cracks—especially when responsibilities aren’t clearly assigned. That’s where Loop’s task features come in. They’re simple, built-in, and great for assigning ownership right where the work is happening, so let’s see how can create tasks, assign them to team members, and keep things moving forward—all without leaving your Loop page.

Let’s start with the easiest way to assign a task in Loop. Just type a slash anywhere on your page and select Task list from the menu. This will insert a simple task list with built-in columns for the task name, assignee, due date, and status. From there, you can start entering your to-dos right away.

To assign a task, click into the Assignee cell for that task. You’ll see a list of suggested people—typically those you’ve recently mentioned or assigned something to. Select a name either by clicking or by using the arrow keys and pressing Enter. That person will be assigned to the task, get a notification in Loop, and the task will also appear in their To Do and Planner task list—automatically synced.

The best part is that everything is live and collaborative. If someone checks off a task, edits the description, or reassigns it, all changes happen in real time. Everyone stays in sync, which is incredibly useful during meetings or planning sessions where you’re capturing next steps on the spot.

You can also add due dates easily. Just click into the cell under the Due date column, and a date picker will pop up. Once selected, the deadline appears directly in the list—helping you track timelines across multiple tasks and team members.

If your task list starts to get longer, you can organize it by status. In the Status column, you’ll see default buckets like “Not started” or “In progress.” You can edit these by clicking in the cell and selecting Add option to create your own custom workflow stages—like “Waiting for review” or “Done.” This is a quick way to turn a simple task list into a lightweight project board.

Beyond the task list, Loop also offers more visual alternatives. You can insert a Progress tracker or a Kanban board from the template gallery if you need a higher-level view or prefer working with columns and cards. These are great for project planning or tracking multiple streams of work across a team.

There’s also a more informal way to assign tasks—just type @ followed by someone’s name. This sends them a notification and highlights their name in the context of your content. It’s useful when you want someone to take a look at something or be aware of a detail—but keep in mind that @mentions alone won’t send the task to their Planner or To Do list. So for anything that requires follow-up, I’d always recommend using a proper task list or tracker.

And finally, a huge benefit of using Loop for task management is its cross-app syncing. If you’ve shared a task list as a Loop component in Teams or Outlook, your teammates can interact with it directly from there. Any updates they make—like checking off a task or changing the due date—are reflected instantly on the original Loop page. No need for manual updates or tracking things in multiple places.
