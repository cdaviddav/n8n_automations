# Organize Smarter: Workspaces, Pages & Components
Next up: Let’s talk about how to organize your content inside Microsoft Loop.

Now that you know your way around the interface, it’s time to look at how Loop is actually structured—because that’s where things can get a bit confusing at first. Unlike other tools where you might only have one layer of information, Loop works with workspaces, pages, and components. If you don’t understand how these elements fit together, it’s easy to end up with a cluttered setup that’s hard to navigate.

So, let’s start with Workspaces. Think of a workspace as the home base for a project, team, or topic. You can create one for anything—a client project, a product launch, meeting notes, or even your personal goals. Inside each workspace, you’ll find pages, and those pages are where the actual content lives.

As you already know, you can view all your workspaces at a glance by clicking the Workspaces tab on the left—or simply by clicking the Loop icon in the top-left corner, which brings you back to your home dashboard. From there, you can also manage your workspaces more easily by opening the More options menu. In grid view, just click the three dots in the top-right corner of the workspace card. In list view, those three dots appear when you hover over the workspace name and move your mouse to the right.

Once you click on the dots, you’ll see several options: you can open the workspace, mark it as a favorite, rename and style it, adjust the sensitivity label, manage members, or leave the workspace entirely.

When you click on a workspace, the list of pages inside it will appear in the sidebar on the left. At the very top, you’ll also notice a Status view for the workspace. If you click on it, you’ll see some useful insights—like which tasks are active within the workspace and where the most recent activity or collaboration has been happening. It’s a helpful way to get a quick overview without digging into every single page.

Each page inside a workspace is like a flexible canvas. You can write text, add headings, create checklists, insert tables, or include Loop components. Just a small note though—Loop pages aren’t quite as freeform as OneNote pages. In OneNote, you can move anything around anywhere. In Loop, the structure is still a bit more linear—you’re working within rows and sections. That said, it’s still super versatile. You can combine different content styles and even turn parts of your content into reusable components, which we’ll talk about later in more detail.

You can also nest pages within each other to create a clear, organized structure. To add a subpage, just click the three dots next to the page name and select New subpage. Alternatively, you can drag and drop an existing page—either to rearrange its position or to place it under another page as a subpage. And if you change your mind, you can just as easily move it back out again.

Inside each page, you’ll usually start with basic content—some formatted text, a few subheadings, maybe a table. But what really sets Loop apart is its use of Components. These are one of the app’s most powerful features. A component is a piece of content inside a page that can also live and update outside the page.

Here’s where it gets interesting: you can copy a Loop component—like a table or task list—and paste it into a Teams chat or an Outlook email. And when someone updates that component from Teams or Outlook, the changes automatically sync back to your original page in Loop. No need for multiple versions or manual updates. Everything stays connected, and everyone stays on the same page—literally.

This kind of real-time syncing across apps is what makes Loop so powerful for team collaboration. It reduces friction, saves time, and keeps your content up to date, no matter where it’s being edited.

Let me give you an example from my own workflow. I usually create one workspace per project, with separate pages for things like meetings, workshops, analysis, and so on. When I’m planning a client workshop and want to brainstorm ideas with my team, I’ll often start a simple bullet list on a Loop page. If the workspace is private—just for me—I’ll share that bullet list as a component in our Teams chat so everyone can contribute. My team can add their thoughts or tweak ideas directly in Teams, and because it’s a Loop component, every update syncs instantly back to the original Loop page. It’s a super smooth way to collaborate without switching tools or worrying about version control.

One tip I’ve learned over time: don’t be afraid to start simple and expand as you go. Create a workspace, add one or two pages, and start building from there. Once you get into the flow, it’s easy to rearrange, split content into new pages, or turn sections into components.

So, to sum it up: workspaces hold everything together, pages are where your content lives, and components are the magic pieces that keep things synced across apps. Once you understand this structure, Loop becomes a powerful tool for both solo work and team collaboration.
