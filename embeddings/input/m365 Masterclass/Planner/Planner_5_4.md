# Collaborate Live: Use Loop with Planner
Next, let’s look at how to collaborate in real time by using Microsoft Loop together with Planner—a powerful combination when you want to turn quick ideas into structured tasks, without losing momentum.

If you’ve ever had a brainstorming session, a running project chat, or a working document where everyone’s adding thoughts at the same time, you know how chaotic things can get. And often, the problem is this: great ideas and action points show up in those moments, but they don’t get tracked or assigned. That’s where Loop steps in.

Loop is designed for live collaboration. It’s a space where you and your team can co-create content—notes, lists, tables, even embedded components like checklists and tasks—all in real time. And the key benefit for us here is that Loop connects directly to Planner, so you can create and manage tasks from inside your Loop workspace, and everything stays synced.

Here’s how it works. Inside a Loop page or component, you can insert a task list. Just type a forward slash and select the task list component. From there, add your tasks, assign them to teammates, and choose due dates—right from within the Loop canvas. These tasks aren’t just static—they’re live Planner tasks, connected to the Microsoft 365 group and visible in Planner itself. That means if someone checks off a task in Loop, it’s also marked complete in Planner. And if you update something in Planner, the change reflects in Loop.

Personally, I like using Loop for meeting agendas where we’re actively assigning work. We go through the plan together, turn decisions into tasks right then and there, and know they’ll be tracked properly afterward without having to retype anything into Planner.

Also, it’s good to know that there’s currently no direct link back from a Planner task to the Loop component where it was created. So even though the tasks sync, there’s no way to jump from a task in Planner back to its original context in Loop—at least for now.

Finally, keep in mind that Loop is still rolling out and evolving. Depending on your Microsoft 365 setup, you might not see all of the features as discussed just yet—but the integration with Planner is already active in the newer Loop-enabled workspaces, especially inside Teams, as we cover in another video of this chapter. And if you want to dive deeper into how Loop works across Microsoft 365, how to create your own pages and components, and how it connects to other tools, there’s a dedicated Loop module later in the course that walks you through all of that step by step.
