# Stay Flexible: Duplicate Plans for Reuse
Now, let’s look at how to duplicate a plan in Planner—perfect when you want to reuse a proven setup without having to start from scratch every time.

If you run similar projects on a regular basis—like onboarding new clients, launching campaigns, or running internal checklists—there’s no need to rebuild the same structure over and over again. Duplicating a plan lets you keep the buckets, task templates, and overall layout, so you can stay consistent while saving time.

To duplicate a plan, open the Planner app and click into the plan you want to reuse. Then go to the top left corner and click the small arrow next to the plan’s name to open the dropdown menu. From there, select Copy plan.

A new window will pop up asking you to name the new plan. Below, you decide whether this will be a personal plan or a shared team plan. If you want to keep it for yourself, leave the group section empty. If you want to share it with a team, select the appropriate Microsoft 365 group from the list.

Below that, you’ll be asked what exactly you want to copy. You can choose to copy just the structure—which includes buckets and task names—or also copy priority, dates, description, checklist or labels.  It really depends on your use case what to carry over.

Once you’ve made your selections, click Create plan. The new plan will be added to your list, and you can start editing it just like any other plan—assign new owners, adjust dates, and customize it for the current project.

Now, this feature also works great if you want to create your own reusable templates in Planner. You can build a generic plan once, with pre-filled buckets, tasks, notes, checklists, and labels—everything you typically need for that type of work. Then, whenever you’re starting a new project, you simply duplicate the plan, tailor the task names and deadlines, and you’re ready to go. It’s a great way to standardize processes while still keeping things flexible. That's actually what I do for certain types of recurring projects. It helps me make sure I’ve thought through everything in advance and don’t forget any major steps or tasks along the way.

Just a quick heads-up—everything I’ve just shown only works for plans that were originally created in Planner. If you’re looking at a plan that shows up in Planner but was originally created in To Do—like a native To Do list—the options will be more limited. Since it wasn’t created in Planner, some features may be missing—and in most cases, native To Do lists can only be viewed in Grid view when accessed through Planner.

In fact, if you would like to duplicate a plan – or rather a todo list, you would need to go back to Microsoft todo and duplicate it from there.
