# Navigate Easily: Explore Planner’s Interface
First, let’s take a look at the Planner interface so you know exactly where to find what you need—specifically, how it works inside Microsoft Teams.

If you’re new to using Planner here, it might feel a bit overwhelming at first. With so many tabs, apps, and notifications, it’s easy to click around without really knowing where to go. But once you understand where Planner lives in Teams and how it’s structured, it all starts to click into place.

First, open Microsoft Teams. In the left-hand sidebar, you’ll see icons like Activity, Chat, Teams, and Calendar. If you don’t see Planner listed yet, scroll to the bottom and click on “Apps.” Search for “Planner,” and open the app called Tasks by Planner and To Do. If you plan to use it regularly—which I definitely recommend—you can right-click it and choose “Pin” so it stays in your sidebar for easy access.

Once the app is open, you’ll notice two main areas: the navigation pane on the left and the detailed view on the right. On the left, you’ll see three main sections by default: My Day, My Tasks, and My Plans. Below those, you might also see any plans you've pinned for quick access. Usually, when you first open Planner, it defaults to the My Tasks view.

The My Tasks view gives you a list of all your tasks across different plans, with key details shown in a table. At the top, you’ll find basic filters that let you narrow down tasks—for example, to see only personal tasks, tasks assigned to you, or flagged emails from Outlook. There’s also a search function if you’re looking for something specific. If you want more control, click the filter icon in the top right. This opens additional options where you can filter tasks by due date, priority, or progress.

Just above these filters, you can switch between different views. The Grid view is the default—each task appears as a row, and the details are shown in columns. If you switch to the Board view, your tasks are displayed as cards grouped by progress: Not Started, In Progress, and Completed. This is a great way to visualize where everything stands. You can also change how the tasks are grouped by clicking the grouping button in the top right.

Personally, I tend to stick with the Grid view and then use filters to zero in on what’s most relevant at the moment.

While My Tasks gives you a complete list of everything assigned to you, My Day shows only the tasks that are due today. You can view them in either Grid or Board format, but you won’t find additional filters here—which makes sense, since the view is already focused on just today’s tasks. It’s a great way to stay in the zone and avoid distractions.

The third section, My Plans, gives you an overview of all your task plans—both shared and personal. It even includes task lists from To Do, which appear as separate plans. At the top, you can filter by categories like recent plans, shared plans, personal plans, pinned plans, or My Teams. There’s also a search bar to help you quickly find what you’re looking for.

You’ll notice that each plan has a unique icon. For example, a purple grid icon indicates a list created in To Do or a personal plan not associated to any group. Other plan, associated to groups, have colored icons with initials. These initials are usually based on the group or team name, and all plans from the same group share the same color. It’s a small visual detail, but it really helps you quickly identify which team a plan belongs to.

That’s the basic layout of Planner inside Teams. Once you get familiar with the structure, it becomes easy to jump between views, focus your day, and manage tasks without digging through different apps.
