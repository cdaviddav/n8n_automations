# Manage Efficiently: Copy, Move & Delete Tasks
Let’s move on and talk about how to copy, move, and delete tasks in Planner—so you can manage your boards efficiently without starting over or making a mess.

Once your plan fills up with tasks, things can get a little overwhelming. You might want to reuse an existing task, shift something to another bucket or plan, or just clean things up entirely. The good news is, Planner makes all of that easy to do—as long as you know where to find the options.

Let’s start with copying a task. This is especially helpful if you’re working on a repeating process, or if a task is similar to one you’ve already created and you just want to tweak it.

In the Board view, click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the task card. In the grid view, you’ll see the three dots right next to the task name. Select Copy task, and a popup will open. You can rename the new task, choose which plan and bucket it should go into, and decide whether to copy things like labels, checklist items, attachments, or other attributes. Once you click Copy, the duplicated task will appear in the target plan you selected, ready for you to update or assign as needed.

Now let’s look at moving a task. Maybe something was created in the wrong bucket, or you realize it belongs in a different plan altogether. Again, go more options via the three-dot menu, and choose Move task. Just like with copying, you can select a different plan and bucket. Once you confirm, the task disappears from the current board and reappears in its new location. It’s a quick way to stay organized without re-creating anything manually.

One important note here: when you move a task to a different plan, only plans that you also have access to will be shown. So if you’re working across multiple teams, make sure you’re part of both groups before trying to move a task between them.

Just a quick heads-up—you can’t move tasks from plans that were originally created in Microsoft To Do. Even though these lists show up in Planner, they’re still To Do lists at their core, and don’t support Planner’s full task management features like moving tasks between plans.

And finally, deleting a task. If something is no longer needed, just open the task, click the three dots, and select Delete or delete selected task. There’s no trash bin or undo button in Planner, so once you delete a task, it’s gone for good. That’s why I usually double-check before deleting—especially if other people are assigned or involved in the task.
