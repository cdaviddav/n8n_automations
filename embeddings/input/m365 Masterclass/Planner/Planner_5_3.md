# Track Smarter: Connect OneNote with Planner
In this video, let’s talk about how to connect OneNote with Planner—so you can keep your notes, context, and tasks all in one connected workflow.

Planner is great for managing tasks and keeping projects on track, but sometimes you need more space for context—like meeting notes, project outlines, or reference materials that support the work behind each task. That’s where OneNote comes in. It gives you a flexible place to capture detailed information, and when you link it to your tasks in Planner, you can move seamlessly between planning and doing without losing the bigger picture.

One thing to mention upfront: there’s no built-in integration between Planner and OneNote—but don’t worry, you can still use the two together effectively with just a couple of simple steps.

Let’s start from the Planner side. When you’re working inside a task, scroll down to the Notes section. This is where I like to paste a link to the relevant OneNote page manually. Just go to OneNote, right-click on the page you want to link, and choose Copy link to page. Then paste that link into the Notes field in your Planner task.

When someone clicks that link, it will – depending on your settings – either open in the OneNote browser or the web version of OneNote. From the web version, you can easily switch to the desktop version by clicking the “Open in Desktop App” button in the top right corner of the browser. This way, anyone viewing the task can quickly access all the detailed context without digging through separate apps or notes.

You can also start the other way around—from OneNote. If you’re taking meeting notes or mapping out a project, you can create a task directly from OneNote by typing the action item, selecting it, and clicking Outlook Tasks in the ribbon. While this technically creates a task in Outlook, that task also flows into To Do and eventually appears in Planner’s My Tasks view under the filter Private tasks. If the due date is today, it will also show up in your My Day view in Planner.

It sounds like a few steps, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a smooth and natural way to connect tasks with notes. You can quickly move from thinking and planning to action—and you always know where to find your background material.

Personally, I love how smooth this connection feels once it's set up. When I flag something as a task in OneNote, I know it’ll show up in Planner without me having to think about it again. It keeps everything aligned without adding extra steps to my workflow.

If you’d like to dive deeper into that workflow—especially how OneNote connects to Outlook and To Do—check out the OneNote module in this course. It walks through that setup in more detail.
