# Sync Tasks: Link Planner with To Do
First of all, let’s look at how to sync Planner tasks with Microsoft To Do—so you can bring all your work into one place and manage everything from a single task list.

If you’re using both Planner and To Do, it’s easy for things to feel scattered. You might have tasks assigned to you in shared plans, personal tasks saved in To Do, and even flagged emails floating around. The good news is—it’s actually quite simple to bring all of that together in one place.

In fact, you don’t have to set up anything manually. As long as you’re signed in with the same Microsoft 365 account across all apps—Planner, To Do, and Outlook—the sync happens automatically in the background.

To double-check that you’re using the right account, just click on your profile picture or initials in the top corner of the app—usually in the top right or left. That will show you which email address is currently signed in. If your tasks aren’t syncing, this is often the first thing to check.

One thing to be aware of: sometimes there’s a small delay between the apps. So if you add or update something in one place, it might take a few seconds to appear in the other. That’s normal and usually resolves on its own pretty quickly.

As we’ve already covered, everything you create in To Do will show up in Planner as well—especially in views like My Tasks or My Day. If you’ve created a list in To Do, it will appear in Planner as a separate plan. However, as mentioned in earlier videos, these To Do lists will have limited features in Planner. For example, you won’t be able to assign tasks, add labels, or use board and chart views—because those features don’t exist in To Do.

The same goes for individual tasks. If a task was created in To Do, it will still show up in Planner, but only the attributes available in To Do will be editable. So you won’t be able to leave comments, add attachments, or apply labels to those tasks in Planner. But if you adjust something like the due date, priority, or progress—those changes will be synced and reflected in To Do as well. Also, when you add steps to your task in To Do, those steps will be included in your task in Planner as a checklist and vice versa.

This background sync creates a really nice flow: you can manage personal tasks in To Do, collaborate in Planner, and still keep an overview in both tools. I like using To Do as my daily task manager and Planner for team work—but thanks to this connection, it doesn’t feel like I’m managing two separate systems.
