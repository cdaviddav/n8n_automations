# Explore Plans: Understand Plan Layout & Info
In this video, let’s zoom out a little and look at how plans are structured in Planner inside Microsoft Teams—and what kind of information you can find in the plan overview.

Now that you know what an individual task looks like and how much detail you can include, it’s helpful to understand how all those tasks are grouped and organized within a plan. This is especially important when you’re working with others, because the plan view is where you get the bigger picture: how things are progressing, what’s coming up, and who’s working on what.

Let’s open one of the shared plans from the My Plans section.

The first thing you’ll see is the Board view, which is also the default view. This is where all your tasks are displayed as cards within buckets. Buckets are simply columns that help you organize tasks by phase, category, or topic. You can structure them however it makes sense for your team. Some teams use them as Kanban board with stages like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done,” while others group tasks by department, project, or workstream.

When planning your bucket structure in Microsoft Planner, note that the bucket attribute is separate from the task status attribute. For example, creating a Kanban board with buckets labeled “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done” overlaps with the status options “Not Started,” “In Progress,” and “Completed.” This redundancy can be avoided since you can group tasks by status in the board view. To streamline your workflow, consider using buckets for alternative groupings, such as by department, project, or workstream, while relying on the status attribute to track task progress. This approach eliminates the need to update both attributes, saving time and reducing confusion.

In the top right corner of the plan, you’ll see the Group by dropdown. This controls how your tasks are organized in the Board view. By default, tasks are grouped by bucket, but you can switch to group by assignee, progress, priority, due date, or label. It’s a great way to shift focus—personally, I like using the “group by assignee” view when I need a quick overview of who’s doing what.

If you’re not a fan of the Board view or just want to see your plan from a different perspective, look at the top of the plan. There, you’ll find a menu that lets you switch between different views: Board, Grid, Schedule, and Charts.

You already know how the Board view works—it’s a visual layout grouped by bucket. If you’ve added labels, due dates, or priorities, you’ll see them directly on the task cards, making it easy to scan for what needs attention.

In Grid view, tasks are listed in rows with more detail shown across columns—similar to what you’ve seen in My Tasks. It’s a more structured way to view everything at once and quickly edit task attributes directly from the list.

The Schedule view displays all tasks with due dates on a calendar. This is really helpful if your plan is deadline-driven or has a time-sensitive timeline. You can even drag and drop tasks to adjust due dates directly on the calendar, which makes rescheduling quick and visual.

The Charts view gives you a snapshot of the overall status of the plan. You’ll see how many tasks are not started, in progress, or completed, along with who has the most assigned tasks and how work is distributed across buckets. I find this view especially useful during team check-ins—it’s great for spotting bottlenecks or identifying when someone is overloaded.

Right next to it, you’ll find the Filter button. This allows you to narrow down your task list by criteria like due date, label, priority, or assigned user. It’s a handy way to focus in on just the tasks that are urgent or relevant for a specific time period.

Now, let’s go back to Grid view for a moment. As you already know, tasks created directly in Planner versus tasks from To Do or flagged emails come with different sets of attributes. When you’re looking at a plan that was created in Planner, you’ll see a detailed overview in Grid view. The columns include everything from assignment and bucket to priority, label, and more.

But if you’re viewing a plan that started out as a To Do list—basically, a personal list that’s now visible in Planner—the Grid view will be much simpler. You’ll only see a few columns next to the task name, such as due date, progress, priority, and the quick look column. The extra task details like buckets or labels simply aren’t available for these types of lists.

Just a quick heads-up—everything I’ve just shown only works for plans that were originally created in Planner. If you’re looking at a plan that shows up in Planner but was originally created in To Do—like a native To Do list—the options will be more limited. Since it wasn’t created in Planner, some features may be missing—and in most cases, native To Do lists can only be viewed in Grid view when accessed through Planner.
