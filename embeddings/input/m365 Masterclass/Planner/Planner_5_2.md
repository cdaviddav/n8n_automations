# Plans & Emails: How Outlook & Planner Connect
Now, let’s talk about how Planner and Outlook connect—because it’s not quite as direct as you might expect, but it still works really well once you understand how the pieces fit together.

Here’s the key: Planner and Outlook don’t connect directly. So, tasks created in Planner won’t just pop up in Outlook’s task list or calendar by default. But that doesn’t mean you’re stuck managing everything separately. There’s actually a very smart middle layer that brings it all together—and that’s Microsoft To Do.

Think of Microsoft To Do as the bridge between Planner and Outlook. Most tasks that are created in Planner—whether they’re tasks you assigned to yourself or ones assigned to you by others—automatically sync to To Do. These will appear either in your Planned view or under Assigned to me, depending on how the task was created.

Since To Do is tightly integrated with Outlook, a large portion of your tasks will also flow into your Outlook task list. But you might be wondering what exactly gets synced—and why I say "almost all" tasks. Here’s how it works:

Only personal tasks—the ones you create in My Tasks within Planner, either in the All view or under Private Tasks—are synced to Outlook. These are considered private tasks because you’re the sole owner, and they’re meant for your eyes only. It makes sense that they show up in Outlook, since Outlook is your personal inbox.

On the other hand, tasks that are assigned to you by others in shared plans do appear in To Do, but they do not sync to Outlook. That’s because Outlook isn’t built for collaborative task management. It’s designed to help you track your own work, not coordinate with others. Shared lists, group tasks, and team assignments belong in tools like Planner or To Do, where collaboration is supported natively.

So in short: if it’s your personal task, you’ll find it in Outlook. If it involves a team or shared responsibility, it stays in To Do and Planner, where collaboration is part of the workflow.

One thing I’d recommend from experience: make changes to your tasks in Planner or To Do, especially when it comes to details like due dates, priority, or notes. While Outlook does reflect changes back for personal tasks, the sync can sometimes lag a little. So yes, you can adjust tasks in Outlook, and those changes will sync back to To Do—and eventually to Planner, but only if that specific attribute exists there. But for the most reliable experience, it’s best to manage your tasks directly in Planner or To Do.

So for example, if you create a task in Planner that's due today, it will automatically appear in To Do under My Day, and it will also show up in Outlook in the To Do bar, flagged for today. If you then update that task in Planner—let’s say you change the priority to “Important”—you’ll see that reflected in both To Do and Outlook. To Do will mark it as important, and when you open the task details in Outlook, it will show up as high priority there too.

Now if you make a change in Outlook, like adjusting the due date, that update will sync back to To Do and eventually also to Planner. Just keep in mind that this sync isn’t instant—it usually takes a few seconds, and in some cases, a couple of minutes for the change to appear everywhere. So the system works smoothly, but there can be a slight delay between apps.

This setup has become my default way of working. I handle team projects in Planner, stay focused with my daily list in To Do, and keep everything time-bound through Outlook. It’s one connected ecosystem that doesn’t feel scattered, and it all just flows once it's set up.

If you’d like to explore this workflow in more detail, be sure to check out the Outlook and To Do modules in this course. There, you’ll find step-by-step examples of how the sync works—both from the Outlook perspective and from within To Do—so you can see exactly how everything connects behind the scenes.
