# Boost Teamwork: Discover Planner in MS 365
For most professionals, managing projects and team tasks can feel chaotic. You’ve got deadlines to track, progress to monitor, and updates flying in from every direction—often spread across chats, emails, meetings, and spreadsheets. It’s easy to feel like you’re constantly juggling too much without a clear overview of what’s actually getting done.

The real issue isn’t the number of tasks—it’s the lack of structure. Many teams rely on scattered tools, informal check-ins, or memory to manage their work. And even when there’s a task board in place, it often becomes outdated or too complicated to keep up with. This leads to miscommunication, duplicated efforts, and important work falling through the cracks.

That’s where Microsoft Planner comes in. Planner is more than just a digital task board—it’s a lightweight project management tool that helps teams stay aligned, organized, and on track. Whether you’re coordinating a small project or managing recurring team tasks, Planner gives you a visual, intuitive way to assign responsibilities, track progress, and keep everyone in the loop.

Fully integrated within Microsoft 365, Planner connects seamlessly with Outlook, Teams, To Do, and Loop. It lets you build simple workflows that don’t require hours of setup or complex tools—just a clear way to organize work and actually get things done.

But most people only use Planner at a surface level, missing out on key features that can make a real difference: buckets, labels, filters, schedules, and integrations that help you go from chaos to clarity.

That’s exactly what this module is here to fix.

You’ll learn how to use Microsoft Planner as your go-to system for organizing projects and collaborating effectively. I’ll show you how to plan smarter, keep track of tasks with less effort, and bring structure to your team’s work—so you spend less time chasing updates and more time making real progress.

By the end of this module, you’ll know how to turn Planner into a simple but powerful system to manage your daily work and team projects with clarity and confidence.

But before we dive into the content, please note that we are only going to cover Planner in Teams, not on the web.
