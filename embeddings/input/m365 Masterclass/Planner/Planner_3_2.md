# Get Organized: Create a New Plan
Now, let’s look at how to start strong by creating a new plan the right way.

By now, you’ve seen how tasks work and how plans are structured. But to actually get started with organizing your team’s or your own work, you need to know how to create a plan—and more importantly, where and how to do it so it’s useful and easy to access later. This is where many people get tripped up. They create plans in random places, forget where they live, or end up with duplicate plans that no one actually uses.

There are two main ways to create a plan in Planner: one for yourself—a private plan—and one for your team, which is shared and collaborative. Both have their place, but the setup process is slightly different, so it’s important to know what you’re creating and why.

Let’s start with creating a plan just for yourself. This is perfect if you’re managing your own tasks, working independently on a project, or simply want a space that stays completely private.

To create a personal plan, go to the My Plans section in the left-hand navigation. In the top right corner, you’ll see a “+ New Plan” button. Click it to get started.

You can choose to begin with a blank Grid or Board layout or pick one of the many templates that Planner offers. Either way, you’ll be prompted to give your plan a name. Choose something meaningful and clear—something that helps you quickly recognize what the plan is for.

Next, you’ll be asked whether to add the plan to a Microsoft 365 group. If you want to keep it private, simply skip this part. Don’t link it to any group. Just click Create, and your new personal plan will appear under My Plans. If you want, you can also pin it to your sidebar for quick access.

Tasks you create in this personal plan won’t need to be assigned to anyone—but you’ll still have access to all the core task features: due dates, checklists, notes, labels, and more. It’s a fully functional planning space, but just for you.

And if you change your mind later—you can still share the plan with others. We’ll cover how to do that in the upcoming video.

Personally, I use Microsoft ToDo for my personal tasks and not a private plan in Microsoft Planner, because I don’t need the functionality of a status and buckets. My private tasks are as the same says a simple tasks list and that’s exactly what Microsoft ToDo is created for.

Now let’s look at the second use case—when you want to create a shared plan for your team. The steps to do that are actually similar to creating a personal plan. Go to My Plans, click on New Plan, choose whether to start with a blank board or use a template, and give your plan a name. Then, in the final step, you’ll be prompted to select a Microsoft 365 group. This is where you choose the team or group that the plan will belong to. Once you assign it to a group, everyone in that group will automatically have access to the plan—it becomes a shared space tied to that team.

Now let’s take this plan one step further and add it directly within the respective team or channel in Microsoft Teams, so everyone can access the Plan directly from within the channel without switching to Planner.

To do that, go to the Teams tab in the sidebar, open the specific team and channel where the plan should live, and click the plus sign at the top of the channel to add a new tab. Choose Planner, and create a new plan or connect to an existing one. Creating a new plan is straightforward—you can either start from scratch or choose from a selection of templates to get up and running quickly.

However, when you're adding an existing plan to a Teams channel, there’s one important thing to be aware of: Teams will only show you plans that are already connected to the Microsoft 365 group associated with that specific Team.

In fact, that’s what we did in the first step, where we created a plan in Planner and tied it to a specific group. However, if you try to add a plan that wasn’t created under this group, it won’t appear in the dropdown when you're trying to link it to the channel.

To avoid this, make sure that when you create a new plan, you associate it with the correct Microsoft 365 group. You’ll see this option during the setup process in Planner—just select the group that matches your Team. If the plan is linked to the right group from the start, it will automatically appear as an option when adding an existing plan to a Teams channel.
