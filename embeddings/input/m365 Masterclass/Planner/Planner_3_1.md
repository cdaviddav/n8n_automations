# Get Started: How to Create a Microsoft 365 Group?
First things first—let’s look at how to create a Microsoft 365 Group. That’s because before you can fully collaborate in Planner, you’ll need to connect your plan to a Microsoft 365 Group. This group acts like the foundation for shared workspaces across Microsoft 365—including Planner, SharePoint, Outlook, and Teams. Without it, you’re basically working solo. With it, you unlock everything from assigning tasks to accessing shared files and notes.

There are three main ways to create a Microsoft 365 Group, and which one you choose depends on where you're working from—Outlook, Teams, or directly inside Planner. But before you dive in, it’s worth checking with your IT admin to make sure you have the permissions to create groups. Some organizations restrict this feature for compliance reasons.

Let’s start with the first option—creating a group in Outlook. If you prefer to begin there, head to the Groups section in the left-hand sidebar. It’s usually located at the very bottom, below your inbox, standard folders, and search folders. If you don’t see it right away, click the small arrow next to Folders to expand the list. Then, right-click on Groups and select New Group.

From there, give your group a name—something simple and descriptive like “Project ABC”—and add a short description if needed. Outlook will automatically generate a group email address based on the name you entered. It will use the group name before the “@” and your organization's domain afterward.

Next, set the sensitivity level if your organization requires it. This usually relates to how confidential or restricted the information in the group should be. Then, set the privacy level. Just to clarify the difference: sensitivity is about how the group handles data internally, while privacy controls who can access the group. For most Planner-related use cases, Private is the better option—this keeps the group visible and accessible only to invited members. If you choose Public, anyone in your organization could join without an invitation.

After that, click Create. A second window will pop up, allowing you to add members right away. You can type in names or email addresses of individuals, distribution lists, or even other Microsoft 365 groups if needed. Once you click Add Members, they’ll be included in the group.

Creating a Microsoft 365 Group via Outlook is especially useful if your planning work is closely tied to email, calendars, or shared mailboxes. But no matter where you start, once your group is created, it’s fully functional across all Microsoft 365 tools—including Planner, SharePoint, and Teams. So you’ll be ready to assign tasks, share documents, and collaborate effectively.

The second option is through Microsoft Teams, which many people already use as their main collaboration hub. Open the Teams app and head to the Teams tab in the left-hand sidebar. At the top, click the Create and Join Teams or Channels button, then select Create team. Just like in Outlook, you’ll give your team a name, write a short description if you like, and choose the privacy level by clicking on the dropdown that defaults to Private. I’d recommend keeping it private, so only people you invite can join—whereas Public means anyone in your organization could access it.

Next, you’ll name the first channel in your team. Once you click Create, another popup will appear where you can add members by typing their names or email addresses. You can also skip this step and add them later—whatever works for you. Behind the scenes, Microsoft automatically creates a Microsoft 365 Group for your team, that has the name of the team, linking it to other apps like Planner, SharePoint, and Outlook. So once your team is set up, you’re ready to start using Planner with full collaboration features.

Ok let’s look at the third option—creating a group directly inside Planner. This is especially handy if you’ve already started a private plan and later decide you want to share it with others. After creating the plan, go to the top-right corner and click the Share button. In the sharing window that opens, select Create group. You’ll see a small pen icon next to your new group name—clicking it lets you edit the name, add a short description, and choose the privacy level. I recommend setting it to Private, so only invited members have access.

Then, simply add your colleagues by typing their names or email addresses. Once you click Create Group, Planner will automatically generate a Microsoft 365 Group linked to your plan. It’s probably the most straightforward way to switch from a private plan to a collaborative one—especially if you’re already working inside Planner and want to stay in your flow.

Personally, I like creating groups in Planner when the plan comes first—and using Teams when the collaboration comes first. It really depends on your workflow, but all three options will get you to the same place: a shared space where you can collaborate, assign tasks, and stay on the same page.
