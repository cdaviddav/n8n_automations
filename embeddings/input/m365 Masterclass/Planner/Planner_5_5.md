# Work in Teams: Manage Planner Tasks Seamlessly
Now let’s look at how to work with Planner directly inside Microsoft Teams—so you can manage your tasks without ever leaving the place where collaboration is already happening.

Yes, technically when you're using Planner, you're already in Teams—because the Planner app is built right into the Teams environment. But beyond the standalone Planner app in the sidebar, there are a few more ways you can make Planner feel like a natural part of your daily workflow in Teams.

One of the most useful options is to add a Planner board as a tab inside a Teams channel. Just open the channel, click the plus icon at the top, choose Planner, and either create a new plan or connect to an existing one. If you're starting from scratch, you can go with a blank board or choose one of the built-in templates to get up and running faster.

Now here’s an important detail to keep in mind: when you’re adding an existing plan, Teams will only show you plans that are already linked to the Microsoft 365 group associated with that specific Team. So if you’re trying to add a plan that was created under a different group—or created as a personal plan—it won’t appear in the dropdown list.

To avoid that, make sure that when you create a new plan, you link it to the correct Microsoft 365 group. You’ll see this option during the setup in Planner—just select the group that matches your Team. Once it’s properly linked, it will automatically show up as an available option when you go to add a tab in the channel.

And if you already have a plan that wasn’t originally linked to a group, don’t worry—you can still fix it. Open the plan in the Planner app, click Share in the top-right corner, and select Add to an existing group. Choose the correct Team group, and after that, the plan will become available to add as a tab in your channel.

Once the plan is added, everyone in that Team will be able to view and collaborate on tasks directly within the channel. It’s a simple but powerful way to bring planning and communication into one space—so there’s no need to switch between apps or lose context between task updates and ongoing conversations.

If you’d like to explore this even further, there’s a dedicated Teams module in the course where we go into much more detail. There, you’ll find practical walkthroughs on how to use Planner more deeply within Teams—including how to create tasks directly from messages, how to work with individual task components like Loop lists, and how to manage everything seamlessly from within your chat or channel environment. It’s a great way to level up your workflow if Teams is your daily hub.
