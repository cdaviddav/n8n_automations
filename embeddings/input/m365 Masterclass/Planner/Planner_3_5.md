# Report Smarter: Export Plans to Excel
In this video, let’s look at how to export your Planner data to Excel—perfect if you want to analyze progress more deeply, create custom reports, or just keep a backup of your plan.

While the Charts view we covered in a prior video gives you a great visual overview, sometimes you need more flexibility. Maybe you want to filter and sort in a way that Planner doesn’t allow, or maybe you need to prepare a summary for stakeholders who don’t use Teams or Planner. Exporting your plan to Excel gives you exactly that freedom—you get a full data table that you can work with however you like.

To get started, open the plan you want to export. Make sure you’re doing this from the Planner app itself—not just within a Teams tab—since the export option is only available there. In the top left corner of the screen, click the small arrow next to the plan’s name to open the dropdown menu. From that list, select Export plan to Excel.

Planner will instantly generate and download an Excel file. You’ll usually see a popup in the top right corner—just click on the file to open it directly. If that doesn’t show up, you can also find the file in your Downloads folder.

Once you open the file, you’ll see your entire plan laid out in a clean, structured spreadsheet. Each task is displayed as a row, and each attribute—like task name, assignee, bucket, priority, progress, due date, labels, and so on—appears in its own column.

What I really like about this export is how neat and usable it is right out of the box. There’s no messy formatting or hidden data. You can do all the usual things you’d expect, like filtering for overdue tasks, sorting by priority, or grouping by assignee. But what’s even more powerful is that you can go a step further—use pivot tables, run custom summaries, or even build your own visual dashboards if you want to do deeper analysis.

Whether you need to prep a status report, share a snapshot with someone who’s not using Planner, or just want to keep a backup for yourself, the Excel export is a quick and flexible way to get exactly what you need.

This is also a great option if you want to present a project update in Excel format, or if you just prefer working in spreadsheets for task reviews. I’ve even used exported plans to create charts in Excel that are more tailored than what Planner itself provides.

One thing to note: the export is a one-time snapshot. If you update your plan later in Planner, you’d need to export again to see the changes reflected in Excel. So it’s not a live connection, but still incredibly useful for reporting or one-off analyses.

Just a quick heads-up—everything I’ve just shown only works for plans that were originally created in Planner. If you’re looking at a plan that shows up in Planner but was originally created in To Do—like a native To Do list—the options will be more limited. Since it wasn’t created in Planner, some features may be missing—and in most cases, native To Do lists can only be viewed in Grid view when accessed through Planner.
