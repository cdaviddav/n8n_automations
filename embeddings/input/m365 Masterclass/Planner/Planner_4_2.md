# Break It Down: Use Checklists & Labels
Next up: let’s look at how to use checklists and labels in Planner to break tasks down and add more structure to your boards.

In the last video, we talked about assigning tasks to make responsibilities clear. But what happens when a single task has multiple parts? Or when you want to track themes or categories across different buckets? That’s where checklists and labels come in. They help you avoid turning your plan into an overwhelming list of micro-tasks, while still giving you the detail and clarity you need.

Let’s start with checklists.

Open any task in your plan. Scroll down to the section labeled Checklist, and start typing in the steps you want to include. Each item becomes a sub-task of the main task—great for breaking down a bigger item into manageable actions. You can check them off as you go, and when all items are complete, Planner will show the checklist as completed directly on the task card.

Checklists are especially helpful when the task doesn’t justify being split into separate cards but still involves more than one step. I use them for things like small delivery steps, review cycles, or preparation tasks. Just keep in mind that checklist items don’t have their own due dates or assignees—so they’re best for simple, internal breakdowns, not for delegation.

And if you’re working with Microsoft ToDo as well, it’s helpful to know that checklists in Planner are the same as steps in To Do. So when a ToDo task is assigned to you and syncs to Planner, the subtasks items come through as checklist items—and vice versa. This means your task details stay aligned across tools, making it easier to manage your responsibilities whether you're working in Planner or To Do.

Now let’s move on to labels.

At the top of each task, you’ll see a color-coded bar labeled Labels. Click on it, and you can assign one or more labels to the task. You can rename the labels to whatever suits your workflow—like “Client Work,” “Internal,” “Waiting for Review,” or anything that helps you group or highlight tasks. For developers that could be: Bug, Feature and Improvement and for someone who manages multiple projects: Project A, Project B and Project C.

I personally like using labels to quickly scan the board and get a sense of what kind of work is where. I usually align my labels with the categories I already use in Outlook—for example, red for external clients, blue for internal work, and green for learning and development. This keeps everything consistent across tools. I also use a few extra labels for things like review stages or tasks that are waiting on input from others. And since you can filter or group your views by label, it becomes really easy to narrow your focus during busy weeks and only look at what matters most in the moment.

One thing to note is that labels are shared across the plan, they are not individual. So when you rename or repurpose a label, that change applies for everyone who uses the plan. That’s why it helps to agree on a label system as a team—or at least keep it intuitive enough that everyone can follow.

Combining checklists and labels is one of the easiest ways to make your tasks more meaningful without adding clutter. They help you see progress at a glance and give just enough structure to stay in control without getting overwhelmed.
