# Assign Tasks Right: Create & Share
First of all, let’s dive into how to assign tasks properly in Planner—so everyone knows what they’re responsible for and nothing falls through the cracks.

Now that you’ve created plans, set up your structure, and learned how to collaborate, the next big step is assigning tasks. A lot of teams skip this or do it inconsistently, which leads to confusion, duplicated work, or tasks that simply get forgotten. Assigning tasks isn’t just about tagging a name—it’s about creating clarity and accountability.

Start by opening your plan and either click Add task in the bucket you want to use, or open an existing task you’d like to update. If you're creating a new task, enter a clear and concise title. Once the task card opens, look for the Assigned to field—usually right near the top.

You can assign a task to yourself or to anyone who is already part of the plan. Just start typing their name or email, and select them from the list. You can also assign a task to multiple people if it's something that requires collaboration. All assignees will see the task in their Assigned to me view, and they'll get a notification depending on their Teams and Outlook settings.

If you don’t see someone in the list, it’s likely they’re not a member of the group yet. You’ll need to add them to the Microsoft 365 group before you can assign anything to them. I recommend doing this right away if you know someone will be working on tasks—otherwise, it’s easy to forget and the task ends up floating around with no owner.

There’s no distinction between main and secondary assignees. If that’s something you want to control more tightly, consider breaking up the task or using labels and checklists to define individual responsibilities.

Note that not only assigned people but anyone who has access to the plan - meaning, anyone who is part of the Microsoft 365 group connected to that plan - can see all tasks, open them, and make changes—regardless of whether they’re assigned to the task or not.

Assignment is really more about clarity and visibility, not permissions. So assigning someone to a task means it shows up in their Assigned to Me list and gives a clear signal that they’re responsible—but it doesn’t limit who can edit the task.

Now, if you’re working on a personal plan, task assignment is optional and often unnecessary. Since the plan is private, you’re the only one seeing it anyway. In that case, assigning tasks to yourself might help you organize things visually, but it’s not required.

Personally, I like to assign every task in shared plans—even if it feels obvious—because it removes ambiguity. It’s a simple step that makes follow-up easier, especially in larger teams.
