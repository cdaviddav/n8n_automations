# Explore Tasks: Understand Task Layout & Info
Next up, let’s take a closer look at what a task actually looks like in Planner and what kind of information you can manage inside it.

Now that you’ve seen how to navigate the main interface in Teams and explored different views , it’s time to zoom in on the most important building block in Planner: the task. A lot of people create tasks and leave them almost empty—but that’s a missed opportunity. Tasks in Planner can carry a lot of helpful context if you know where to put it, and using them properly can save you and your team time, follow-ups, and confusion.

To explore a task in more detail, let’s go back to the My Tasks view. To open the task details, just click on any task card if you’re in Board view. If you’re in Grid view, you can open the details by clicking the small exclamation mark that appears next to the task name.

At the top of the task window, you’ll see the task title. This should give a clear idea of what the task is about. I usually keep it short but specific—something that’s easy to recognize at a glance without needing to click in every time.

Just below the title, you can assign the task to yourself or to others. You can even assign multiple people, and the task will appear in each person’s “Assigned to Me” list. I recommend assigning every task unless it's part of a private list you're using for your own personal to-dos. Assigning ownership helps avoid confusion and ensures things actually get done.

Below the assignees, you’ll find the option to add labels. Labels are color-coded and fully customizable. You can use them for categories like topics, departments, urgency levels—or however it fits your workflow. Personally, I use labels to indicate task types, like “Admin” or “Client,” so I can quickly batch similar tasks together and stay efficient.

If you're in Board view, you’ll also see the bucket dropdown. This lets you move the task between columns, depending on how you've structured your board—like phases in a process or categories of work. That said, if you’re not using buckets in your plan, you can simply leave this field empty.

Next is the progress status. You can choose between “Not started,” “In progress,” and “Completed.” It’s a small detail, but keeping this updated helps both you and your team quickly understand where things stand.

Then there’s the priority setting. You can mark tasks as low, medium, important, or urgent. I usually only use this when a plan starts to get crowded, and I want to make sure the most critical items stay top of mind.

Under that, you’ll find the start date and due date. Setting a due date ensures the task will automatically show up in My Day when it’s time to tackle it. If you’re working on a larger project with multiple workstreams, adding a start date can help give more structure. These dates also become useful later when you're looking at plan views like the calendar or timeline.

Next is the repeat dropdown. You can choose whether the task repeats on a regular schedule or just runs once. This is helpful for recurring items like weekly reports or monthly reviews.

Now scroll down to the notes field. This is where you can add helpful context—anything from links to quick explanations. Below that, you’ll find the checklist section. If your task has multiple steps, this is a great way to break it down. You can add as many checklist items as you want, but just keep in mind: all checklist items share the same due date as the parent task. If you need different due dates, you’ll need to create separate tasks instead.

Below the checklist, there’s the option to add attachments. This is great for uploading reference files, templates, or anything related to the task. And finally, there’s the comments section. This is where you or your teammates can leave updates or ask questions. Anyone assigned to the task will be notified when a comment is added.

One important thing to know: all task details—notes, attachments, checklists, and so on—can be viewed and edited by anyone who has access to the plan, not just the assigned users. So keep that in mind when adding sensitive info.

Now, everything I just described applies to tasks that were created directly in Planner. If a task was created in To Do but shows up in Planner, the layout will be more limited. You won’t have the option to assign a label, move it to a bucket, or add attachments or comments. All the other fields—like title, due date, and checklist—are still available. In addition, if you're looking at a flagged email, it will have the same limitations as tasks created in To Do—except for attachments, where the attachment is actually the original email itself.

Let’s quickly look at what a task looks like in Grid view. Here, each task appears as a row, and the key details are shown in columns. The default columns include the task name, the plan it belongs to, due date, priority, progress, and a “Quick Look” column that tells you whether notes or a checklist have been added. You can’t change which plan a task belongs to from here, but you can update most of the other fields directly in this view.

One quick tip: if you hide a column using the small dropdown arrow next to the column name, you can bring it back by clicking the plus sign on the far right and selecting “Add column.” Just note that you can’t create entirely new columns—only re-show the default ones that were hidden.
