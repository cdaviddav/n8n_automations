# Clean Up Safely: Delete or Leave Plans
Finally, let’s talk about how to clean up your Planner space safely—whether that means deleting a plan you no longer need or leaving one that’s no longer relevant to you.

As you start using Planner more regularly, it’s easy for your plan list to get cluttered. Maybe you’ve tested a few things, finished a project, or been added to a plan you no longer need to be part of. Either way, knowing how to properly delete or leave a plan helps you keep things organized without accidentally losing important data or access for others.

Let’s start with deleting a plan. You can only delete a plan if it’s a personal plan—meaning it’s not attached to a Microsoft 365 group. To do this, go to the Planner app and open the plan you want to remove. Click the small arrow next to the plan name at the top left to open the dropdown menu. There, you’ll see the option to select Plan details. Click on it and a sidebar on the right will open. At the very bottom, you’ll see the option to delete this plan. Once you confirm, the plan will be permanently removed.

Now, if the plan is connected to a group—like one created in a Teams channel or added to a shared Microsoft 365 group—you won’t be able to delete it unless you're the group owner. That’s because the plan is part of the group’s shared workspace, along with files, conversations, and other tools. Deleting the plan would impact everyone, which is why only group owners have that control.

But even if you can’t delete the plan, you can still leave it if you no longer want to be actively involved. To do that, click the small arrow next to the plan name in the top left to open the dropdown menu. At the bottom of the list, you’ll see the option to Leave plan. Once you confirm, you’ll be removed as a member of that plan.

However, please note that when you leave a plan in Planner, you are effectively removing yourself from the Microsoft 365 group associated with that plan. Since all plans within the group are tied to the same membership, leaving the group means you lose access to all plans within that group, not just the one you initially left. Additionally, you would no longer have access to other group resources, such as the SharePoint site or shared files.

You’ll still be able to view the plan—but since you’re no longer an active member, you won’t be able to make edits or changes. So you’ll see the content, but your access will be read-only.

Just a quick note—you can’t leave plans that you created yourself. If you want to remove those, you’ll need to delete them instead. Personally, I try to review and clean up my plans regularly—especially for test plans, one-off projects, or anything that’s finished. It keeps things focused and helps me avoid getting distracted by things that are no longer relevant.

Just a quick heads-up—everything I’ve just shown only works for plans that were originally created in Planner. If you’re looking at a plan that shows up in Planner but was originally created in To Do—like a native To Do list—the options will be more limited. Since it wasn’t created in Planner, some features may be missing—and in most cases, native To Do lists can only be viewed in Grid view when accessed through Planner.

In fact, if you would like to delete or leave a plan – or rather a todo list, you would need to go back to Microsoft todo and delete or leave it from there.
