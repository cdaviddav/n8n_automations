# Collaborate Easily: Share Plans with Teams
Next up: let’s look at how to share your plans with your team so that everyone’s on the same page and can collaborate easily.

In the last video, we looked at how to create a new plan—either for yourself or for a team. But what if you created a plan privately and now want to share it with others? Or maybe you’re not sure who can see your plan and how access works? This is something that confuses a lot of people, especially because sharing a plan isn’t just about sending a link—it’s about how the plan is connected to a Microsoft 365 group.

When it comes to sharing a plan in Planner, there are two common scenarios. Either you’ve created a personal plan that you now want to share, or you’re working with a team plan and want to add more members to it.

Let’s start with the first case: you have a personal plan and you’d like to share it with others.

Open the plan, and in the top right corner, you’ll see a Share button. If the plan is still private, you’ll also notice a small lock icon next to it—that’s your visual cue that this plan is currently only visible to you.

Click on the Share button. A popup will appear where you can either create a new group or add the plan to an existing group.

If you choose to create a new group, you’ll be prompted to name it, add a description, choose the privacy settings, and most importantly, add members by entering their email addresses. Once you click Create Group, the plan will be connected to this new Microsoft 365 group. All group members will now have access to the plan. You’ll also notice that the plan’s icon changes—from the standard purple icon to a colored one with the group initials. In the plan details, you’ll see a note confirming that the members of the plan are now part of the group. From this point on, any files, chats, or shared content related to this group will be accessible to all members. And if you need to, you can continue adding more members using the Add Members field.

Alternatively, if you already have an existing group that you want to connect your plan to, click the Share button again and select Add to an existing group. A dropdown menu will appear where you can choose the group you want to link the plan to. Once you select it and confirm, the plan will be shared with all members of that group—and again, everyone in that group will now have access to the plan and any associated materials.

Now let’s look at the second scenario: you already have a plan that’s part of a group, and you want to share it with more people. In this case, sharing the plan means adding new members to the Microsoft 365 group. To do that, open the plan, click on the Share button, and in the popup that appears, add new members by entering their email addresses. Once you click Invite, they’ll be added to the group—and automatically gain access to the plan and everything else tied to that group.

Now let’s connect this back to Microsoft Teams.

As you saw in the previous video, plans can be added to specific Teams channels. But what if you created a plan earlier that wasn’t linked to a group, and now you want to bring it into a channel?

No problem—you can still fix that. Open the plan in the Planner app, click on the Share button in the top right corner, and choose Add to an existing group. Select the group that’s connected to the relevant Team. Once that’s done, the plan will show up as an option when you go to your Teams channel, click the plus sign to add a new tab, and select Tasks by Planner and To Do.

Once the plan is added as a tab in the channel, everyone in the team will be able to view and collaborate on it directly from within that shared space. It’s a simple but powerful way to keep tasks and conversations connected—without having to switch between apps or lose context.

Just a quick heads-up—everything I’ve just shown only works for plans that were originally created in Planner. If you’re looking at a plan that shows up in Planner but was originally created in To Do—like a native To Do list—the options will be more limited. Since it wasn’t created in Planner, some features may be missing—and in most cases, native To Do lists can only be viewed in Grid view when accessed through Planner.

In fact, if you would like to share a plan – or rather a todo list, you would need to go back to Microsoft todo and share it from there.
