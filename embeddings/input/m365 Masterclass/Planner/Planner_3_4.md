# Master Plans: Understand Views & Progress
Next, let’s recap the different plan views and explore how to use the Charts tab in Planner to track team workload and overall progress at a glance.

By now, you’ve seen that each plan offers different views—Board, Grid, Schedule, and Charts. Each one gives you a different way to look at your tasks and helps you focus on what matters depending on the situation.

Board view is the default, and it's great for managing tasks visually by moving them through bucket

s or stages. Grid view gives you a structured list of all tasks, which is useful if you prefer working with columns and rows, or need to make quick edits. Schedule view shows your tasks on a calendar, so you can easily spot upcoming deadlines or overlaps.
And then there’s Charts view, which provides a visual summary of the plan’s progress and task distribution. When it comes to tracking performance and making sure work is evenly distributed across the team, Charts is where you want to go.

Open any plan and switch to the Charts view from the top menu. You’ll see two main areas: on the left, a set of visual charts, and on the right, a list of task cards. These task cards are grouped by bucket by default, but you can change the grouping using the dropdown in the top right corner—just like you can in the Board view.

Now let’s focus on the visual side.

In the top left, you’ll see a chart showing tasks by status. This gives you a quick snapshot of how your plan is progressing—how many tasks are still not started, which ones are in progress, which ones are late, and which ones have already been completed. It’s a helpful health check for the entire plan.

Just below that, you’ll find a bar chart by bucket. This shows how tasks are distributed across your buckets, giving you insight into where most of the activity is happening. If you’re using buckets to represent phases or categories, this helps you quickly identify any areas that may be overloaded or lagging behind.

To the right, there’s a bar chart showing tasks by priority. Here, you’ll get a breakdown of how many tasks are marked as urgent, important, medium, or low. This view is especially useful when your plan grows and you want to keep the most critical work top of mind.

Finally, at the bottom, there’s a chart showing task distribution by team member. This is where you can easily spot workload imbalances. If one person has significantly more tasks than others—or someone else has none—it’s a great cue to redistribute work more evenly. It’s also a quick way to see who’s involved in the plan and how much they’re handling.

Together, these charts make it easy to track progress, spot issues early, and have more productive conversations in your team check-ins. Just remember: the accuracy of these charts depends on how regularly task progress is updated. So make it part of your routine to mark tasks as "In progress" or "Completed"—otherwise, the numbers won’t reflect reality.

Now, while this overview is helpful, keep in mind that it only works if task progress is updated consistently. Tasks won’t magically move from "Not started" to "In progress"—someone has to change that manually. So, I recommend making it part of your workflow to update task status regularly, either during team meetings or as tasks are picked up and completed.

The Charts view doesn’t give you super-detailed reporting, but it does give you everything you need for regular check-ins, status updates, and spotting problems before they grow. I use it all the time before sync meetings—it saves me from digging through individual tasks and helps me ask the right questions instead.

Just a quick heads-up—everything I’ve just shown only works for plans that were originally created in Planner. If you’re looking at a plan that shows up in Planner but was originally created in To Do—like a native To Do list—the options will be more limited. Since it wasn’t created in Planner, some features may be missing—and in most cases, native To Do lists can only be viewed in Grid view when accessed through Planner.
