# Outlook Calendar: Protect Your Time: Show Availability & Set Out-of-Office
Alright, let’s talk about how to actually protect your time on your calendar—especially when you’re not around.
Whether you’re on vacation, at a training, or just out for the day, the last thing you want is to come back to a calendar full of meetings you didn’t agree to.

And just to clarify—I don’t mean the usual out-of-office email reply. I’m talking about the “Show As” settings in your Outlook calendar. It’s one of the simplest but most powerful ways to communicate your availability. Whether you're truly out, heads-down on focused work, or simply open for meetings, this setting helps others understand how they should treat your time.

Let’s start with Out of Office, since it’s the most clear-cut one.
To block time as out-of-office, open your calendar and double-click on the time slot you want to reserve. As always, you can also click New Appointment from the ribbon or just hit Ctrl + N to create a new event.

In the event window, look for the “Show As” dropdown at the top and switch it to Out of Office. Outlook will mark that time in purple, and when others check your availability using the Scheduling Assistant, they’ll see you're completely unavailable.

If you're away for a full day, just check the All-day event box. It’s great for vacation, public holidays, or days where you're offline altogether. For longer absences, just adjust the start and end dates accordingly.

You can also set recurring out-of-office entries. There was a time I used this to block time for gym and lunch breaks every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I’d just create a recurring event from 11:00 to 12:30, mark it as Out of Office, and that time would stay protected.

Now let’s look at the other “Show As” options, because they’re just as useful:

Busy is the default for most meetings and appointments. This tells others that you’re booked during that time and helps avoid double bookings. It shows up in solid blue in the Scheduling Assistant. Whenever you schedule a meeting or accept one, busy is chosen as the default status and I also don’t recommend changing this for such standard meetings or appointments. 

Then there’s Tentative. It shows up as blue and white striped on your calendar and signals that you might be busy—but you’re not fully committed yet. This is the default status when you accept a meeting tentatively, which usually means you're interested but need to confirm based on other priorities or potential conflicts. Personally, I never set Tentative manually—I only see it when I’ve clicked “Tentative” in a meeting invite.

Next, there’s Working Elsewhere, which I’ve seen becoming more common over the past few years. A lot of colleagues use this to indicate when they’re working from home. Typically, they’ll block off an entire day as Working Elsewhere so the team knows they’re available—but not for in-person meetings. It’s a great way to give context without having to explain it in every invite or chat.

And finally, there’s Free. This means the time is completely open for scheduling. You could technically mark an event as Free—like a personal reminder or placeholder—but in most cases, it doesn't make sense to do this with real meetings. Free is what your calendar shows when there’s nothing else scheduled, so others know that time is available.

As a general rule, Outlook will automatically mark accepted meetings as Busy, and tentatively accepted ones as Tentative. But you can always adjust it manually. Just double-click on any meeting or appointment and use the Show As dropdown to change the status.

I usually only do this for calendar entries I’ve created myself—like time blocks or personal appointments—when I want to be intentional about whether that time is treated as Busy or Out of Office. It’s a small detail, but it helps keep your availability clear and your calendar working for you, not against you.

If you ever want to keep an event private, you can click the Private button in the ribbon—right next to the “Show As” field. That way, others will see your status - Busy, for example-, but not the details of what you're doing. I use this when I want to block personal appointments or note something sensitive that doesn’t need to be shared.

And like I mentioned earlier, if you’re truly out—on vacation or at an offsite—it’s always a good idea to combine your out-of-office calendar entry with an automatic reply in Outlook Mail. That way, your availability is consistent across your calendar and inbox, and you don’t have to keep repeating yourself.

Also good to know: when you mark time as Out of Office in your Outlook calendar, your Teams status updates automatically to reflect it. Teams will show a purple status circle next to your name and display a message in chat saying you’re currently out of office. So if someone tries to reach out, they’ll see it right away—no need to update your status manually.

Other calendar statuses sync with Teams too. If you’re marked as Busy, Teams will show you as “Busy” or “In a meeting.” But if your time is marked as Tentative or Working Elsewhere, Teams won’t block your availability—you’ll still appear online unless something else overlaps.

It’s a small detail, but the automatic sync between Outlook and Teams makes it easier to communicate your availability without any extra steps.
