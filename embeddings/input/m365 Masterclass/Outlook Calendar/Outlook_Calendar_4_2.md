# Outlook Calendar: Sync Globally: Manage Multiple Time Zones
Next up, let’s take the guesswork out of scheduling across time zones.

If you regularly work with colleagues or clients in different parts of the world, manually converting time zones gets tiring fast—and it’s easy to make mistakes. Outlook has a few built-in features that let you manage multiple time zones effortlessly, so you can schedule meetings with confidence and avoid the “wait, what time is it there?” confusion.

Let’s start by adding an additional time zone to your calendar.
Go to the File tab, then click Options, and choose Calendar from the sidebar. Scroll down to the Time Zones section. You’ll see your current time zone already set, and right below it, there’s an option to enable a second time zone. Check the box, add a label—like “New York” or “Client”—and pick the time zone you want to add from the dropdown. Once you click OK, both time zones will appear side by side in your calendar view.

This is super helpful if you work regularly with someone in a different region. For example, I usually have my own time zone on the left, and two of my client’s time zone right next to it. That way, when I’m scheduling something, I can immediately see if I’m suggesting a 9 AM call or accidentally booking them for something at 6 in the morning.

Unfortunately, Outlook doesn’t allow you to display more than three time zones side by side in the calendar view—but there’s a simple workaround for those one-off situations.
When you’re creating a new meeting, click the small Time Zones icon next to the start time. This lets you schedule the meeting using another person’s time zone, rather than adjusting it manually. Once you hit send, Outlook converts the meeting to your local time—but here’s the neat part: when you open the meeting again, it still shows the original time and time zone you selected. That makes it easier to keep track of what you planned and when, especially if you're coordinating across regions.

Most of the time, I’m fine working with the three time zones I’ve set up. But for those occasional calls outside the usual regions—like with someone in Asia or a new client in a different time zone—this little feature comes in really handy. It saves me from doing mental math or checking conversion tools every time I set up a meeting.
