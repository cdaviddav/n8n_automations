# Outlook Calendar: Stay in Sync: Link Calendar with Microsoft Loop
Next up, let’s look at how you can stay aligned and move faster as a team by using Microsoft Loop to support meeting collaboration—before, during, and after the call.
We’ve all been in meetings where decisions are made, tasks are thrown around, and people nod in agreement—but afterward, it’s unclear who’s doing what or where to find the notes. The real challenge isn’t just capturing what was said—it’s making sure everyone can easily contribute, stay updated, and work from the same page without creating a mess of disconnected documents. And that’s where Microsoft Loop comes in, built for real-time collaboration across Microsoft 365.

When you create a Teams meeting in Outlook, you can include a Loop component directly in the invite or during the meeting itself. Loop pages are essentially shared workspaces where everyone can contribute simultaneously—whether it’s notes, task lists, or next steps. It’s like working in a shared OneNote page, but even more dynamic.

And Loop components are live, portable, and always up to date. That means you can embed the same component across multiple places—like Teams chats, Outlook emails, or Loop pages—and no matter where someone edits it, the content syncs everywhere instantly. It’s a simple but powerful way to keep everyone aligned without constantly forwarding new versions or chasing updates.

One way to use this is by adding a Loop component to a meeting invite. You can do that by opening the meeting from your Outlook calendar and clicking into the body of the invite. Then, in the toolbar under the Insert tab, choose Loop components—you can pick from templates like checklists, paragraphs, tables, or Q&A.

This is a great way to give your team a place to prepare ahead of time, collect agenda items, or even start capturing notes before the meeting begins. Everyone invited can open the Loop right from the invite and add their input—even if they don’t end up joining live. It’s especially useful when you want a shared space to build alignment before the meeting kicks off. And as long as someone is on the invite, they’ll have access—no need to manage additional permissions.

Just adding a Loop component to your meeting invite and leaving it untouched can feel like a missed opportunity. While it’s great to have it there, the real value comes when you actively connect it to the rest of your workflow. Since Loop components aren’t automatically tied to a specific workspace, you can easily reuse or move them wherever they’re most helpful.

Even after the meeting ends, the Loop component remains active—so you can continue editing notes, updating checklists, or collaborating asynchronously right from the meeting invite or Teams chat. It becomes an evolving workspace, not just a one-time note.

Now, you might be wondering: where does the component actually live once you’ve added it to a meeting? That part is simple—it lives in your personal Loop space and is stored in OneDrive. You can find your Loop components in Loop under Recent pages and components. It’s not tied to a specific workspace or page unless you move it there manually. So if you want to organize it into a project workspace later, you can always copy and paste it into the right place.

Additionally if you search for Loop components, you can find them in in OneDrive under the folders “Attachments”.
