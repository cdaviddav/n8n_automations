# Outlook Calendar: Save Time: Save Time: Customize Your Calendar Setup
Let’s start by tweaking a few key settings so your calendar actually supports how you work.
Most people never touch their calendar setup. And sure, things function okay out of the box. But if your calendar feels cluttered, hard to scan, or full of small annoyances, there’s a reason: the defaults were never designed with your workflow in mind.

But before we dive into those changes, let’s make sure we’re all looking at the same layout.
Open Outlook and click the calendar icon in the navigation pane—or just press CTRL + 2 if Calendar is the second tool pinned in your sidebar. Because as I’ve shared in the first module on Outlook Mail, you can easily jump between the apps in your navigation bar by pressing CTRL + the respective number. 

Once it’s open, you’ll see the calendar taking center stage. On the left, there’s a mini calendar at the top—usually showing two or more months. Below that, you’ll see your active calendars, along with any shared ones from your team or department.

At the top, in the ribbon, you’ll see different view options. For now, let’s switch to Work Week. That’s the view I use by default because it gives me plenty of space to plan my Monday through Friday without the distraction of weekends, which I usually don’t need for scheduling at work.

Now let’s customize a few key settings to make your calendar work more smoothly in day-to-day life.
Start by opening your Calendar Settings. In the desktop version of Outlook, go to the File tab, then click Options, and select Calendar from the menu on the left.

Let’s begin with working hours.
Outlook uses these settings to suggest meeting times and to show your availability across the organization. By default, working hours are usually set from 8:00 to 17:00. You’ll see these hours in a lighter shade on your calendar view—at least in the dark grey theme I use, they appear light grey, while non-working hours are a darker grey.

This visual difference helps you quickly see what falls inside or outside your working day. It also affects how others see your availability in the Scheduling Assistant—your working hours show up as lighter blocks, while anything outside appears darker, signaling you might be unavailable.

So if you tend to start earlier or work a bit later, make sure to update this. I personally set mine from 8:00 to 17:30—this gives me a bit of buffer at the end of the day and makes my calendar more reflective of how I actually work. It also helps guide others when they’re trying to book time with me.

Right below working hours, you can also define your work week and set the first day of the week. For me, it’s pretty standard—Monday through Friday, with Monday as the first day of the week. But if you work weekends or have a non-traditional schedule, this is the place to make Outlook reflect that.

Next, let’s move to appearance and layout, starting with how your calendar is displayed on screen. Go the View tab in the top ribbon. You’ll see a section called Layout—this is where you can adjust things like density and the reading pane.

We’ve already selected the Work Week view earlier, which gives a clean overview of your Monday to Friday. Now, if your calendar feels too cramped or cluttered, you can adjust the spacing to make it easier to scan.

In the View tab of the ribbon, look for the “Use Tighter Spacing” button. If it’s turned on, everything in your calendar will appear more compact. Click it once to turn it off, and Outlook will switch to a more spacious layout. I personally prefer it off, because the added space between items makes the calendar easier to read—especially when you’re glancing at it throughout the day.

Next, let’s adjust the Reading Pane—you’ll find this option in the View tab as well. Click on the “Reading Pane” dropdown, and choose whether you want it to appear on the Right, Bottom, or not at all (Off).In Calendar mode, I usually keep it Off to maintain a clean and focused layout. If I need to check the details of a meeting, I just double-click on it. But if you prefer to quickly preview event information without opening the full invite, setting the reading pane to the Right can be a useful option.

While we’re in the View tab, there are a few more layout elements worth knowing about: the Daily Task List, the Folder Pane, and the To-Do Bar.

Let’s start with the Daily Task List. If you set it to Normal, it appears at the bottom of your calendar, with each column showing the tasks or flagged emails scheduled for that day. If you choose Minimized, it shrinks down to a small bar at the bottom—still showing tasks, but in a more compact view.

This can be helpful if you like to manage your tasks directly from the calendar. But if you prefer a cleaner layout—or if you already use Microsoft To Do or Planner to track your tasks—you can turn it Off completely. That’s what I usually do. When I’m looking at my calendar, I just want to see appointments and meetings without any additional clutter.

Next up is the Folder Pane—that’s the sidebar on the left, where you see your mini calendars and the list of calendars you’ve added or shared.
Click on Folder Pane in the View tab, and you’ll get three options: Normal, Minimized, or Off. I personally leave it on Normal because I like seeing the mini calendar at the top and having quick access to other team calendars or shared views.

And finally, there’s the To-Do Bar—the same panel you might be familiar with from Outlook Mail view. When turned on, it appears on the right side of your screen and can show a mini calendar, a list of upcoming appointments, your tasks, or even contacts. Honestly, I find this a bit redundant when I’m already in Calendar view. You’re already looking at your full schedule—so having another mini calendar and appointment list on the side just feels like visual noise. That’s why I keep it turned Off.

Even though I leave most of these layout options on their default settings, it’s still good to know what they do. If you prefer a more customized setup or want to tailor Outlook to the way you plan and prioritize, these small adjustments can make a big difference.

Once you’ve finished setting things up, your calendar will feel much more intuitive—easier to scan, faster to manage, and better aligned with how you actually work.
