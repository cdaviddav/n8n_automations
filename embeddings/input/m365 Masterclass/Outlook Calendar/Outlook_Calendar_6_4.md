# Outlook Calendar: Track Action Items: Flag Emails & Use Loop
Next, let’s look at how to make sure follow-ups actually happen—without relying on memory or scrolling through old meeting notes.

We all leave meetings with action items, whether it’s something you need to do or something you’re waiting on from others. But too often, those next steps fall through the cracks—especially when they’re not written down or there’s no reminder to follow up. Outlook gives you a few easy ways to stay on top of those tasks and even send automatic follow-ups, so you don’t have to chase people manually.

Let’s start with email-based follow-ups.
If you're sending a message after a meeting—maybe to share notes or assign next steps using the Reply All function—you can flag the email for follow-up before you hit send. Just click Follow Up in the ribbon and choose when you want the reminder. Outlook will then add this to your To Do Bar and task list, so it shows up alongside your other tasks.

One important note: this flag only applies to your copy of the email. The recipients won’t see a task or get a reminder unless they manually flag it themselves. But even so, it’s a great way to keep track of what you’ve asked others to do. I use this all the time when I’m waiting on a response and want Outlook to nudge me in a few days—just so I don’t have to rely on memory or dig through old threads later.

Another, more advanced—but very effective—way to make sure meeting action items are actually followed up is by combining Outlook, Teams, and Loop. It’s less of a single tool and more of a smart three-way integration across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. Let me explain.

As you might already know, you can schedule meetings from either your Outlook calendar or the Teams calendar. Since both calendars are connected through the same Microsoft 365 account, your appointments will always stay in sync across both platforms. However, if you want to unlock more powerful tracking features for action items, you need to create the meeting directly from the Teams calendar, not from Outlook.

This small difference matters—because creating the meeting in Teams enables you to integrate Loop meeting notes right into the invite, giving you a collaborative space for agenda items, live note-taking, and task assignments that sync across tools. It’s a simple tweak to your workflow, but one that can make your meetings more actionable and your follow-up process much smoother.

Go to your Teams calendar, either double-click a time slot or click New Meeting in the top-right corner. Fill out the usual details—title, required attendees, time, location, and any message you want to include. Nothing new so far.

Now here’s the important part. At the very bottom of the meeting invite, you’ll see a small option that says “Add an agenda.” When you click it, Loop steps in and automatically creates a structured component with three sections: Agenda, Meeting Notes, and Follow-up Tasks.

This component is embedded directly into the invite. You can start filling out the agenda before sending the invite, so everyone receives it with context right from the beginning. Once you click Send, the invite goes out to all attendees—with the Loop component included. And even after the invite is sent, you can come back and update it. Just reopen the meeting from your Teams calendar, scroll to the bottom, and edit the content in the Loop component as needed.

A quick heads-up: this feature only works when you schedule or edit meetings via Teams. If you open the invite from your Outlook calendar, the Loop component won’t be visible—which can be a bit confusing. So if you want to use this feature, always open the invite from the Teams calendar.

Now, when it’s time for the meeting, and you join through either Teams or Outlook, you’ll see the familiar Teams meeting interface. What you want to do is click the Notes tab at the top. This opens the embedded Loop component in a side panel on the right. You’ll see the agenda you prepared, along with editable sections for meeting notes and follow-up tasks. And because it’s a Loop component, everyone in the meeting can contribute live. You can add talking points, capture decisions, assign action items—all in real time, together. 

And the best part is that when you click the plus button to add a follow-up task, Loop automatically opens a task list component where you can assign the task to specific people on the spot. Thanks to the seamless Microsoft 365 integration, the task instantly shows up in the assignee’s To Do list and Planner—so nothing slips through the cracks.

If you click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the component, you’ll see more options—like copying the component link, checking access permissions, seeing where it’s been shared, or opening it directly in the Loop app.

After the meeting ends, the notes don’t disappear. In fact, you have a few easy ways to access them again. You can reopen the meeting in your Teams calendar and scroll down to the Loop component. Or, you can copy the component into another Loop page if you want to reuse or store it elsewhere. And finally, you can open the Loop app, click on Meeting Notes in the left-hand sidebar, and browse a list of all meeting notes connected to your calendar.

This feature has become one of my personal favorites, especially for recurring meetings or team syncs. It keeps everything in one place, makes collaboration easier, and removes the pain of sending separate meeting summaries afterward.
