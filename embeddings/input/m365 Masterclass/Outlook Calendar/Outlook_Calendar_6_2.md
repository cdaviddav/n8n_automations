# Outlook Calendar: Respond Quick: RSVP from Email Previews
Let’s move on and look at how to handle meeting invites faster—without needing to open each one.

When your calendar starts to fill up, responding to meeting requests can become just another set of clicks in your day. Opening the invite, reviewing the time, clicking Accept—it adds up. But Outlook actually gives you a quicker way to manage this right from your inbox, so you can RSVP in seconds and stay focused on your flow.

If a meeting invite lands in your inbox, you don’t need to double-click to open it. Just click once on the email in the email list to preview the message, and Outlook will show you the basic details right there. From the preview pane, you'll see Accept, Tentative, and Decline as well as the option to “Propose New Time.” All the options are just one click away. Once you select your response, Outlook will automatically update your calendar and handle the invite for you—no need to open the full message.

This is something I use all the time, especially when I already know whether I can join or not. If the meeting looks relevant, I just accept it straight from the preview and move on. If I’m unsure, I might open the invite and check the meeting details to decide how to respond. 

Assuming, you want to accept or decline a meeting, you can also choose whether or not to send a response to the organizer when accepting a meeting. For example, when you click Accept, a small dropdown appears with a few options: you can send the response as-is, edit the response before sending, or choose not to send a response at all.

The best practice—and what I personally do—is to always send a response. It’s the most transparent and professional way to let the organizer know where you stand. Plus, it helps them keep track of attendees. If you don’t send a response, your calendar will update, but the organizer won’t see anything on their end. To them, it will still look like you haven’t replied at all.

Most of the time, I send the default response without editing it. But if there’s something I want to flag—like needing to leave early or join a few minutes late—I’ll quickly edit the reply before sending. It’s a simple way to communicate expectations without needing a separate email.

If the suggested meeting time doesn’t work for you, Outlook gives you a better option than just declining. You can use the “Propose New Time” feature to suggest an alternative that fits your schedule. There are two ways to do this: you can either tentatively accept and propose a new time, or you can decline and propose a new time. If you choose to accept tentatively, the meeting will still appear in your calendar with a tentative status. If you decline, it won’t be added to your calendar—unless the organizer accepts your new suggestion.

In both cases, the organizer will receive your proposed alternative and can choose to accept it, ignore it, or follow up with a different time. It’s a helpful way to resolve conflicts without dropping out of a meeting you still want to attend.

On the flip side, if you’re the organizer and someone sends you a proposed time, you’ll receive an email notification. You can either accept the proposal directly or click “View All Proposals” to open the Scheduling Assistant. That lets you compare options and see if the suggested time works for everyone. If you accept it, Outlook automatically updates the meeting and sends out a revised invite with the new time—keeping everything else the same.
