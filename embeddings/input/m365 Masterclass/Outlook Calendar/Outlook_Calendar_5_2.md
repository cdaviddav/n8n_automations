# Outlook Calendar: Unify Your View: Merge Multiple Calendars
Next up, let’s make sure you’re not missing anything by bringing all your calendars into one clear view.

It’s easy to lose track when your schedule is spread across multiple calendars—your main one, a shared team calendar, and on top you’d like to make sure you have your boss’ schedule on top of your mind. The problem is, switching back and forth between them creates blind spots, and you risk double-booking or missing something important. So let’s look at how to view multiple calendars side by side or in a unified overlay, so you always have the full picture.

Start by opening the calendars you want to see.
In the left sidebar of your Outlook calendar, you’ll see a list of available calendars—your own, shared calendars from your team or organization, group calendars, and any others you’ve added. To display one, just check the box next to it. Outlook will automatically open it alongside your primary calendar.

If someone’s calendar isn’t already listed there—like a colleague in another team or department, you can add it easily. Go to the Home tab in your calendar view, click Add Calendar, and choose From Address Book. Search for the person you want to add, click their name, click Calendar at the bottom and hit OK. Their calendar will now appear in your list, and you can check the box to view it like any other.

By default, Outlook shows them side by side in separate columns. This can be helpful if you’re trying to compare schedules across people or projects. For example, I often have my manager’s calendar open next to mine so I can quickly check when they’re available or what’s on their plate for the day.

If you prefer a cleaner view, you can also overlay calendars instead of viewing them side by side.
When you have multiple calendars open, go to the left sidebar, right-click on the name of any additional calendar, and select Overlay. This will stack that calendar on top of your primary one, combining them into a single view. Each event is still color-coded based on which calendar it belongs to, so you can easily tell them apart.

You can overlay more than two calendars if you like, or mix and match—overlay two, and keep a third one open separately next to them. It’s flexible, depending on what works best for you.

Personally, I prefer the side-by-side view most of the time. Overlay can look a bit too busy when a lot is going on, and I find it easier to scan each calendar separately without missing details or getting distracted by overlapping events. But it’s great to have the option, especially if you’re trying to coordinate across calendars and want to see everything in one place.

Now, if you open several calendars at once—usually around four or more, depending on your screen size—Outlook will automatically switch to Schedule View. This changes the layout to a horizontal timeline, where each calendar appears as a row across the top. It’s helpful if you’re comparing multiple people’s availability, but for day-to-day planning, I find it a bit harder to read. You lose the familiar grid of your calendar, and it can feel a bit cluttered. So if your view suddenly changes, it’s probably because you’ve hit that threshold.

One thing to keep in mind: opening multiple calendars doesn’t actually merge them into one. It just gives you a more unified view so you can plan better. Each calendar still stays separate in the background.
