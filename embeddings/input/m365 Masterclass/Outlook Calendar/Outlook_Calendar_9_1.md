# Outlook Calendar: Coordinate Better: Manage Calendar Access
Let’s talk about how to make calendar coordination smoother by managing who can see—and do what—with your calendar.
If you’re working closely with a team, supporting someone else’s schedule, or just want to avoid endless back-and-forth about availability, sharing your Outlook calendar properly can save a ton of time and confusion.

By default, most calendars are set so that people in your organization can see your availability as free or busy—without any details. That’s already helpful when someone tries to schedule time with you. But in many cases, you might want to go one step further and give people permission to see more details—or even edit and manage your calendar directly.

To check or change your calendar permissions, go to your calendar view and right-click on your calendar name in the left panel. Then select Sharing Permissions. Alternatively, you can also click the Share Calendar button in the ribbon at the top, under the Home tab, and select your calendar. Both options will take you to the same permissions window, where you can see who already has access and what level of permission they’ve been given.

The different permission levels—like Can view when I’m busy, Can view titles and locations, or Can view all details—are fairly self-explanatory. They range from the most basic view, where someone can only see when you’re free or busy, to more detailed views that include meeting titles, locations, and full content. This allows you to strike the right balance between visibility and privacy, depending on who you’re sharing with. For example, I usually stick to “Can view titles and locations” for general team members. But before changing anything, I believe it’s a good idea to think about who really needs what level of access before granting full visibility.

Now if you want to add someone, you can click Add to give access to someone new. Once added, you can choose from the different permission levels. You can also remove someone’s access at any time from the same permissions window—just select their name and click Remove.

And if you’re the one receiving shared calendar access, you’ll find the calendar under Shared Calendars in your Outlook sidebar. From there, you can open it, overlay it with your own calendar, or view it side by side as we have already discussed in another video.
