# Outlook Calendar: Schedule Easy: Set Up Meetings with Recurrence & Reminders
Next up, let’s talk about how to take the repetition out of scheduling.

If you’re constantly re-creating the same meetings or forgetting to follow up on recurring tasks, Outlook’s built-in tools can take that work off your plate. Features like recurrence and reminders help you build structure into your calendar—so you stay organized without having to think about it every time.

Let’s start with recurring meetings.
You can create a recurring meeting the same way you’d create any regular meeting. Either double-click a time slot in your calendar or click New Meeting from the Home tab. Once the meeting window opens, look for the Recurrence button in the ribbon at the top or simply click on the button saying “Make Recurring” right next to the End Time. 

Once you click Recurrence, a pop-up will open where you can set the pattern—daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or even a custom setup. You can pick the specific days, times, and also set when the series should end. I use this all the time for recurring 1:1s, weekly team check-ins, quarterly reviews, or even my deep work sessions that I try to block at the same time every day. Once it’s set, Outlook takes care of the rest and creates all future meetings for you.

If you ever need to make a change, just click on one of the meetings in the series. Outlook will ask whether you want to open just this occurrence or the entire series. If you choose the single meeting, you can make adjustments without affecting the rest—Outlook will give you a heads-up that the change only applies to that one instance. If you pick the full series, any updates you make will apply across all future meetings, and Outlook will remind you before you hit send.

One quick thing to keep in mind: when you create a recurring meeting, Outlook sends out one single invite that covers the entire series. So if you're invited to a recurring meeting, don’t be surprised if you only need to accept it once—that one response applies to all future occurrences. And just like with any individual meeting, if you add a Teams link, it will automatically show up in every meeting in the series, so no need to add it manually each time.

Now let’s talk about reminders, which play a big role in making sure people actually show up. Honestly, I don’t know anyone who doesn’t rely on that little pop-up to join a meeting on time.

By default, Outlook sets a 15-minute reminder for new appointments and meetings. You can change that when you’re creating or editing the event—just look for the Reminder dropdown near the top of the meeting window.

Personally, I leave it at 15 minutes. It’s what most people are used to, and over time, we’ve all kind of been conditioned to expect that nudge right before a meeting starts. You can change it, of course—but just keep in mind that if you set something unusual, like 2 minutes or 30 minutes, there’s a good chance someone will miss it.
