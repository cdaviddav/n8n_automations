# Outlook Calendar: Never Lose Notes: Connect Calendar to OneNote
Let’s move on and talk about one of the easiest ways to keep your meeting notes organized—by connecting your Outlook Calendar directly with OneNote.

We’ve all had those meetings where great ideas are shared, tasks get assigned, and then… nothing happens because the notes are scattered in random docs or buried in your inbox. The challenge isn’t just taking notes—it’s keeping them connected to the right meeting so you can actually find and use them later. Here, OneNote comes into play. 

To get started, just open a meeting from your calendar. In the ribbon, you’ll see a button that says Send to OneNote. When you click it, Outlook will give you two options: either take notes for yourself, or share notes with the meeting. Most of the time, I just use the private notes option to keep my own thoughts and takeaways linked to the meeting, but you can also share collaborative notes if your team uses a shared notebook.

For both options, you’ll be prompted to choose a notebook and section where you want the meeting notes to be placed in. Once chosen, Outlook will create a new OneNote page and link it to that specific meeting. You’ll see the meeting title, time, participants, and even the agenda if it was included in the invite—all automatically added at the top of the page. From there, you can type, tag, or drop in files like you would in any other OneNote page.

And as I mentioned earlier, when you create personal meeting notes, OneNote automatically includes a direct link back to the original Outlook meeting. So if you ever need to revisit the invite, you can just click that link and land right back in your calendar. However, that link isn’t included when you're creating shared notes—which is a bit of a limitation.

That said, when you do create shared notes, Outlook will automatically generate a OneNote web link and add it to the meeting invite. This makes it easy for everyone to access the shared page and collaborate in real time.

I really like using this for recurring team or project meetings. It builds a running archive of shared notes, all organized by date and meeting title. That way, when someone asks, “What did we decide last time?” you can just scroll back and check—no digging through folders or emails.

Next to using the natively built-in OneNote integration in Outlook meetings, there’s also a small but handy trick if you're working on a larger screen or using split view. You can simply drag and drop a meeting from Outlook into OneNote. Just grab the meeting from your calendar and drop it into any open OneNote page. This is very similar to dragging an email into OneNote and it essentially does the same. 

You are asked if you would like to attach a file or insert a printout. If you choose to attach a file, an Outlook .msg file will be embedded in the OneNote page, which you can open later. If you select insert as a printout, the entire email will be captured as an image, meaning, however, you won’t be able to edit or annotate within the text.

So if you’re planning to take actual meeting notes, I’d definitely recommend using the dedicated Meeting Notes button in the Outlook invite—that’s the most structured and reliable option. The drag-and-drop method is better suited when you just want to reference a specific meeting, maybe to link back to its details or attachments in a broader note. It’s more about quick access than full context.
