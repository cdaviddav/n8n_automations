# Outlook Calendar: Highlight Key Events: Create Custom Views
In this video, let’s look at how to simplify your calendar by creating custom views that highlight only the events that really matter.

When your schedule gets busy, your calendar can start to feel overwhelming. Not everything on there is equally important—but Outlook shows it all the same. That’s where custom views come in. They let you filter out the noise and focus only on what you need—whether that’s client work, project prep, or personal tasks.

To get started, head to the View tab in the calendar ribbon and click Change View. You’ll see a few default options you can try out. Besides the classic calendar layout, there’s also a List View, which displays all your events in a running list instead of a grid. I’ll be honest—I’ve rarely seen anyone use this view in practice, but if you prefer scanning events in a linear format, it might be worth exploring.

In any case, once you’ve clicked on Change View, go ahead and select Manage Views. This opens a list of all your current calendar views and gives you the option to create a new one from scratch.

Click New, give your view a name, and choose Table as the view type. Then, select the third option—“for all Calendar folders”—so the view is available across your Outlook setup. Hit OK, and now you’re ready to customize.

There are a lot of settings you can adjust here, but let’s focus on what I think is the most useful: the Filter function. Click on Filter, and you’ll see several ways to narrow down what shows up in this custom view. You can filter by specific keywords, meeting organizers, or other fields—but my go-to is filtering by categories.

To do that, go to the second tab called More Choices, then click the Categories button. Select the ones you want this view to show—like “External,” “Recruiting,” or anything that makes sense for how you’ve set things up. Click OK to close the filter settings, and OK again to save everything.

Now choosing this new calendar view will only show events that match your selected categories. It’s a great way to cut through the noise—especially if you want to prepare for something specific, like a project review, or just get a better sense of how much time you’re really spending on deep work or high-priority tasks.
