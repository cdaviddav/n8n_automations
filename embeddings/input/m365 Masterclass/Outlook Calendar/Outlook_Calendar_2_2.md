# Outlook Calendar: Plan Smarter: Navigate Calendar Views, Search & Multitasking
In this video, let’s look at how to plan smarter by navigating your Outlook Calendar more efficiently—so you can quickly find what you need, stay focused while multitasking, and move through your schedule with less friction. Whether you’re reviewing your week, jumping to a specific date, or comparing multiple calendars, Outlook gives you simple tools to stay in control without wasting time.

Earlier, we set our view to Work Week, which I find ideal for getting a clear overview of Monday to Friday. But of course, Outlook offers several other view formats, depending on how you like to plan.

If you're looking for a more compact or collaborative layout, you can try Schedule View. You’ll find it in the View tab, usually right next to the Day and Week views. Schedule View shows your calendar in a horizontal timeline, making it easier to compare multiple calendars side by side—like your own and a team calendar. It’s especially useful when coordinating across people or departments.

That said, I don’t personally use it very often. On smaller screens, it only shows a few days at a time, and I feel like I lose the bigger picture. But it’s a great option to be aware of if you're often juggling multiple schedules.

With your preferred view settings in place, let’s talk about how to navigate quickly through your calendar.
You can move between weeks or months using the arrow buttons at the top of the calendar. But if you want to jump straight to a specific date, there’s a quicker way, which I love to use: use the mini calendar on the left. Just click on any date to go there instantly, or click and drag across multiple days to display a custom time range. I use this all the time when I want to zoom out and review the next two or three weeks—without having to switch to Month view.

To return to today, you can click the Today button—either at the top of the calendar grid or in the ribbon, depending on your version of Outlook. One thing to keep in mind: if you selected a custom range in the mini calendar earlier, your view might have changed from Work Week to something else. In that case, just click back into the View tab and reselect Work Week to reset it.

Now on to one of my favorite time-savers: the Search Bar. And yes, you are absolutely right, you can also search meetings and not only emails in Outlook. Just go to the search bar at the top of your calendar view and type in any keyword—like a project name, a person, or a meeting title—and Outlook will instantly filter your calendar to show matching events.

If you want to narrow things down even further, click the small arrow on the right side of the search bar—this opens up advanced search options. You’ll be able to filter by things like attachments, keywords in the body of the event, organizer, required attendees, or subject line. These filters are incredibly helpful when your calendar is packed and you're trying to track down that one meeting from last quarter.

Once you click into the search bar, Outlook also opens a Search tab in the ribbon. There, you'll find some of the most commonly used filters, and you can also choose which calendar folders to search through. Plus, if you often search for the same things, you’ll see a list of recent searches—which makes it easy to repeat them without starting from scratch.

If you want to keep a calendar handy for quick reference, you can right-click on it and select “Open in New Window.” This works for both your own calendar and any shared calendars you have access to. Personally, I don’t use this feature very often because I’m used to switching between Mail and Calendar using Ctrl + 1 and Ctrl + 2. But if you prefer working in separate windows, this can be a great alternative. For example, you can have your calendar open in one window and your inbox in another, and simply switch between them using Alt + Tab. It all comes down to how you like to organize your workspace.
