# Outlook Calendar: Filter Invites: Auto-Accept or Decline Meetings
Let’s kick off this chapter by looking at a quiet but powerful feature—automatically accepting or declining meeting invites based on your preferences.

If your calendar feels like it’s constantly filling up with low-priority invites, double bookings, or meetings you’re not planning to attend, this feature can help cut through the noise. Outlook offers built-in tools to help filter and manage incoming invites, so you can protect your time without replying to every request manually.

You’ll find these settings under File > Options > Calendar, then scroll down to Automatic Accept or Decline. Click the Auto Accept/Decline... button to open a separate window.

There are three rules available.

The first one allows Outlook to automatically accept meeting requests and remove canceled meetings. This can be useful if you regularly get invited to recurring team check-ins or updates and want Outlook to manage those entries without needing your input. It helps keep your calendar current with zero manual work.

The second rule is to automatically decline conflicting meeting requests. If you’re already booked at a certain time, Outlook will reject any overlapping invites—no extra steps, no notifications. It’s a helpful filter if your days are fully scheduled and you want to avoid even seeing double bookings. 

The third option is to automatically decline all recurring meeting requests. As soon as this is turned on, any recurring invite that comes your way—regardless of sender, topic, or frequency—will be declined by default.

Now here’s something important to keep in mind: this all-or-nothing logic applies to all three rules. There’s no way to set exceptions, apply filters, or limit the rules to specific people or types of meetings. You can’t say “only decline recurring meetings from outside my team” or “only accept meetings under 30 minutes.” Once a rule is on, it applies to every incoming invite that matches the condition, without any nuance.

That’s why I personally don’t use these settings—and to be honest, I don’t know many people who do. They’re helpful in very specific scenarios, like for someone in a senior role who gets overwhelmed with recurring invites, or for a shared mailbox that needs to stay clean. But if you prefer to stay in control and make those choices yourself, you’re better off leaving these unchecked and handling invites manually.

Lastly, just note that these rules only apply to new invitations going forward. They won’t change anything that’s already on your calendar, and you can still override them manually at any time.
