# Outlook Calendar: Reuse Appointments Fast: Create Meeting Templates
Next up, let’s look at how to save time by creating simple templates for meetings or appointments you schedule again and again.

Whether it’s a recurring 1:1, a weekly sync, or a client kickoff meeting that always follows the same format, re-typing the same details over and over adds unnecessary friction. Outlook doesn’t have a built-in “template” button, but there are a few simple ways to create reusable meeting formats that make scheduling much faster.

There are two ways to use templates for Outlook appointments, for two different use cases. 

First, start by creating a meeting or appointment as you normally would. Fill in all the usual details—add a title, invite required attendees, set the time and date, and include any other relevant information. Then, in the Meeting tab at the top, go all the way to the right and click on View Templates in the ribbon. This opens a sidebar on the right side of the window.

Here, you’ll see a list of predefined templates, and you can easily create your own by clicking + Template at the bottom of the list. Just enter a name for your template (this is for your reference only and won’t appear in the actual invite), and then type out the body text you’d like to reuse. Once you’re done, click Save.

One thing to note: this method only supports plain text. You won’t be able to format your content with bold or italic text, add bullet points, or use headings. It’s great for quick, simple messages, but if you need more structure or visual formatting, it might fall short.

That’s exactly where the second method for using Outlook invite templates comes in. Start by creating a meeting or appointment just like you normally would. Add the title, any standard agenda items or notes in the body, adjust the time settings, and set any reminders or Teams meeting links if needed. You can even include attendees if you typically meet with the same people. Once everything is set, instead of sending the invite, go to File > Save As, and save the meeting as an Outlook Template file—or .oft and give your template a clear name, maybe something like “Project Kickoff.” 

To use a template, in the Ribbon section “Home”, go to the New Items menu in Outlook Calendar, go to More Items, and select Choose Form. In the Look In dropdown, select User Templates in File System, and you’ll see your saved templates. Select the one you need, make any quick edits, and hit send. If you frequently use templates, consider pinning the template folder or saving shortcuts for even faster access. 

If you prefer to save your template somewhere other than the default location, simply choose a different folder when saving it and click Save. This makes accessing it even faster. Instead of navigating through Outlook menus, you can just double-click the file from your chosen folder, and it will open as a new email, ready to customize and send.
