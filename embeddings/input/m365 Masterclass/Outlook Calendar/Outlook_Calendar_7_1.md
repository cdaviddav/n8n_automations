# Outlook Calendar: Sync Your Work: Link Calendar with Mail & To Do or Planner
First of all, let’s look at how to connect your calendar with the tools you already use to stay organized—like Mail, To Do, and Planner.

Your calendar is where the structure of your day lives—but the actual work often shows up somewhere else. Personal tasks in To Do, project plans in Planner… they all compete for your attention. The real challenge is pulling everything together in one place so you’re not jumping between apps or losing track of what to do next. That’s what we are going to tackle now. 

As we covered back in the Outlook Mail module, you can flag emails so they automatically appear in Microsoft To Do and Planer under the Flagged Email section. These same tasks also show up in your To Do Bar in Outlook, letting you see your action items right alongside your calendar. It’s a great way to turn email requests into tasks without needing to copy anything manually.

You can also take it one step further by bringing those tasks directly into your calendar.
To do that, go to your Calendar view, select a weekly view and then, click on the View tab, and enable either the Daily Task List by setting it to “Normal” or show the To Do Bar on the right by selecting to-do bar and tasks. This will display your flagged emails, Planner tasks, and anything else you've created in Microsoft To Do—all in one place.

Now, if you're into time-blocking, this is where it gets really useful. You can simply drag a task into your calendar and block time for it. Outlook will turn it into an appointment, so you’re not just seeing your meetings but also the tasks you’ve committed to. It doesn’t send out an invite or mark it as a meeting—just a scheduled slot that keeps you on track.

The default time block will usually be 60 minutes, or slightly less if you’ve customized your meeting lengths—for example, to 50 minutes. You can always adjust the duration by dragging the edge of the block or editing the details.

I really like this feature because it saves me from having to retype the task or manually create a new calendar entry—it just takes a quick drag-and-drop, and it’s on my schedule.
