# Outlook Calendar: Delegate Smart: Set Permissions for Assistants
In this video, let’s look at how to fully delegate your calendar to someone else—like an assistant, a team lead, or anyone who helps manage your schedule.
Giving someone access to see your calendar is one thing—but what if they need to actively manage it for you? Accepting meetings, sending invites, responding on your behalf… that’s where delegation comes in.

Instead of just sharing your calendar, you can assign delegate permissions. This gives someone control to manage calendar items as if they were you—with options to decide exactly how much control they have.

To set this up, go to the File tab, then click Account Settings and select Delegate Access. From there, click Add, search for the person you want to delegate your calendar to, and select them from the address book. Click Add at the bottom and Ok to close the window. 

Now comes the important part—setting their permission levels. Outlook will ask what access you want to grant for different areas like Calendar, Inbox, Tasks, and more. For most assistants, usually Editor permissions is granted for the calendar. That lets them create, edit, or delete meetings on your behalf.

You can also give access to your Inbox. This is useful if your delegate needs to keep an eye on meeting invites or follow-up emails. If you only want them to see your messages, choose Reviewer. If they should also reply or manage your inbox, go with Editor.

Next, you’ll see a checkbox that controls whether meeting-related emails—like invites, responses, or cancellations—should go to the delegate. If you want your assistant to handle all scheduling logistics, make sure to check this box. That way, your inbox stays clear and they’ll be the one responding, tracking changes, and keeping things up to date.

Once you’ve finished setting this up, the delegate will see your calendar listed in their Outlook sidebar under Shared Calendars. From there, they can create meetings as you, respond to invites, or make adjustments without needing to check in every time.

One thing to note: when a delegate takes action on your behalf—like accepting a meeting or sending an invite—Outlook makes this visible. So the recipient will see something like:
“Accepted by [Assistant's Name] on behalf of [Your Name]”
This keeps things transparent, so everyone knows who handled the response.

As you might have seen, this is the usual working mode for executive assistants who manage your day-to-day activities and schedules. For some people, it might even be an option during vacation or leave, when you want someone to temporarily step in and make sure nothing slips through.

And of course, you can remove or adjust permissions any time by going back to the same Delegate Access window.
