# Outlook Calendar: Collaborate Easily: Integrate Teams Meetings
Now let’s talk about how to make collaboration easier with the built-in Microsoft Teams integration in Outlook.
If you’re working in a hybrid setup—or just have a lot of virtual meetings—you’ve probably found yourself jumping between Outlook and Teams all day. The good news is, at least when it comes to scheduling, you don’t have to.

As we’ve already touched on a few times in this Outlook Calendar module, you can create and manage Teams meetings directly from Outlook. It keeps everything connected in one place and saves you from switching tabs unnecessarily. So let’s take a closer look at how it works.

When you're creating a new meeting in Outlook, just click the Teams Meeting button in the ribbon. Outlook will automatically generate a Teams link and insert it into the meeting invite. This works whether you’re scheduling a one-on-one or a larger group call. You don’t need to open Teams separately or copy-paste anything—it’s all built in.

If you find yourself scheduling Teams calls all the time, you can actually save a step by setting Teams as the default meeting type. Just go to File > Options > Calendar, scroll to the Calendar options, and check the box that says “Add online meeting to all meetings.” This way, every new invite you create will automatically include a Teams link, without needing to click anything extra.

Once the meeting is on your calendar, joining is just as simple. From the Outlook reminder, your calendar view, or the invite itself, you can join the Teams call with one click. I personally use the calendar pop-up reminder to join directly—it’s the fastest way, especially when your day is packed back-to-back.

If you’ve accidentally closed the meeting reminder—or just prefer another way to join—you can always launch the Teams call directly from your calendar, whether you’re using Outlook or Teams. In Outlook, simply open the meeting invitation and click the Join link. In Teams, it’s even easier. Head to your calendar, and a Join button will appear next to the meeting shortly before it starts. You don’t even need to open the full invitation—just click Join right from the calendar view and you’re in.

Another great part of the Outlook–Teams integration is that the meeting chat is synced automatically. Once the meeting starts, everyone invited will see the chat appear in Teams—even if they join late or access it later. And if someone shares files, links, or notes during the call, they’ll be stored right there in the Teams meeting chat. That means you can easily revisit key takeaways or action items without digging through your inbox afterward.

The same is true for recurring meetings. If you create a series with a Teams link, the chat and shared content stay persistent across each instance of the meeting—so you build up a running thread over time. I find this especially helpful for regular check-ins or project syncs where notes and context carry forward week to week. 

If you're organizing a more formal or external meeting, it’s worth taking a moment to review the Meeting Options. Just double-click the meeting invite in your calendar and click the “Meeting options” link in the body of the invite. This opens a browser window where you can fine-tune settings like who can bypass the lobby, who can present, and whether the meeting should be recorded—really useful for larger or more sensitive calls where you want more control.

Personally, I often set “Who can bypass the lobby” to “People in my organization” to keep things moving, but for external meetings, I prefer to keep the lobby enabled. I also regularly adjust who can present, especially in bigger meetings where I don’t want everyone sharing their screen. And if I know the meeting needs to be captured—like for a training session—I’ll turn on automatic recording so it starts without needing to remember it during the call.

Since there are several detailed settings you can customize, it’s worth exploring the different tabs to see what fits your workflow—and what’s better left as the default.

And finally, any meeting you schedule in Outlook with a Teams link will automatically show up in your Teams Calendar as well. That way, if you're spending more of your day in Teams, you can still see and join your meetings without switching apps. Everything stays in sync, whether you're working in Outlook or in Teams.
