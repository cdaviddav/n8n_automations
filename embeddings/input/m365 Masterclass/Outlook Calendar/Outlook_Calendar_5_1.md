# Outlook Calendar: Spot Priorities: Use Color Categories & Labels
First of all, let’s make your calendar easier to scan by using color categories and labels to spot what really matters.

As your calendar fills up, it can quickly start to feel overwhelming. Meetings, focus time, personal blocks—they all blend together. But with a few simple tweaks, you can turn that mess into a clear visual overview by using Outlook’s color categories to instantly identify priorities and create a calendar that’s easier to navigate at a glance.

Let’s start by setting up and customizing your categories.
To do that, go to any calendar item, right-click it, and hover over Categorize. Here, you’ve got a few options. You can clear all existing categories if you want to start fresh, assign one or more to the selected event, or click All Categories to fully customize your list.

Clicking on All Categories opens the full list of Outlook’s built-in categories. Alternatively, after selecting a calendar event, you’ll see a “Meeting” or “Appointment” tab appear in the ribbon, and from there, you can also access the Categorize button directly.

Once you’ve opened the categories, In the pop-up that appears, you can rename existing categories, delete the ones you don’t need, or create entirely new ones using the buttons on the right.
For example, I’ve set up categories like “External,” “Internal Team,” “Internal Org,” “Personal,” “Recruiting,” “Training and Development,” “Travel,” and one for “Deep Work.” That might sound like a lot, but it works for me. Your list should reflect your own needs and the kind of work you do. Some people stick to three or four, while others go all in with ten or more. There’s no right or wrong here—just what helps you stay organized.

Once your categories are set, you can start applying them to events.
Right-click any calendar item, hover over Categorize, and pick the color you want. Outlook will highlight that event in the assigned color, making it easy to spot at a glance.

You can also apply a category right when you’re accepting a meeting. Just click the meeting invite, and before you hit Accept, choose a category from the dropdown in the top ribbon. That way, it’s already sorted and color-coded before it even hits your calendar.

If there’s one category you use more than the others, it’s worth setting it as your Quick Click.
Just go to the Categorize dropdown and select Set Quick Click, then choose your preferred category. From that point on, whenever you click the little colored square next to a calendar item Outlook will automatically apply that category with a single click. It’s a small tweak, but it makes tagging your most common items a lot faster.

What’s really nice is that categories are shared across Outlook.
Once you’ve set them up, you’ll see them not just in your calendar, but also in Outlook Mail, your Tasks, and the To Do Bar. So if you flag an email from a client, and you’ve labeled that category as “External ,” the same label and color will carry through when the task appears in your to-do list. It brings a sense of consistency to your whole workflow.

Setting up categories takes just a few minutes, but once you start using them consistently, your calendar becomes much easier to read, and your priorities stand out without you needing to open each event.
