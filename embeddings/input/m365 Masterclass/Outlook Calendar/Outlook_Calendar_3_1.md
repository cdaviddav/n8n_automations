# Outlook Calendar: Avoid Confusion: Use Appointments vs. Meetings Right
Alright, let’s clear up one of the most common mix-ups in Outlook Calendar—appointments versus meetings.
At first glance, they look pretty much the same, and honestly, most people use the terms interchangeably when they talk about their schedule. But in Outlook, they behave very differently—and getting them mixed up can lead to confusion, missed invites, or unnecessary back-and-forth.

In this video, I’ll walk you through the difference between the two, when to use each one, and how to avoid those small mistakes that can lead to unnecessary confusion.

Let’s start with the basics. An appointment is time you block for yourself. No one else gets notified, and it doesn’t show up on anyone else’s calendar. Think of it as a personal placeholder—it could be time for focused work, lunch, travel, or simply a reminder to step away from your desk.

There are a couple of easy ways to create an appointment.
The quickest one I use is just double-clicking on any time slot in my calendar—that opens it up right away. You can also click the "New Appointment" button on the top left if you're on the Home tab. And if you're into shortcuts, Ctrl + N works too—as long as you're already in the calendar view.

If you don’t add anyone to the invite, Outlook automatically treats it as an appointment. You can give it a title, location, color category, and even set a reminder—but it stays completely private.

Now, if you add attendees, it becomes a meeting.
That’s the key difference. A meeting involves other people. Outlook will send out invitations, track RSVPs, and automatically update everyone's calendars when something changes. Use this anytime you’re coordinating with others—whether it's a 1:1, a team sync, or a client call.

If you want to turn an appointment into a meeting, you’ve got two options.
The first is to click “Invite Attendees” at the top of the appointment window. That expands the item into a full meeting invite, where you can add required or optional people, set the date, and choose a location.

The second option is to click “Teams Meeting” instead. It does the same thing—adds attendees and turns it into a meeting—but with one difference: Outlook automatically sets the location to a Teams call and drops the meeting link into the body of the invite. That’s handy if you already know it’s going to be virtual.

Now to be honest, I don’t really worry about whether something starts out as an appointment or a meeting—at least not when I’m just blocking time for myself. As long as I don’t add anyone to it, it stays on my calendar and doesn’t go out to anyone else. And since I usually just click into the calendar to create something, Outlook treats it as a meeting by default anyway.

In the end, it kind of comes down to habit and how your workflow is set up. But it’s still good to know the difference—especially when you're coordinating with others or explaining what’s happening on your calendar.
