# Outlook Calendar: End Scheduling Hassles: Use the Scheduling Assistant
Let’s start with ending the back-and-forth of trying to find a meeting time that works for everyone.

Scheduling meetings across teams, departments, or even just two busy calendars can quickly become a frustrating guessing game. In this video, we’ll look at how to use Outlook’s Scheduling Assistant to simplify the process and find available time slots without all the email ping-pong.

Start by creating a new meeting. You can double-click on a time slot in your calendar, click New Meeting from the Home tab, or simply use the shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + Q. Once the meeting window is open, add the people you want to invite in the To field.

Then, instead of manually picking a time, click on the Scheduling Assistant tab in the ribbon. This opens a timeline view that shows everyone’s availability side by side.

Busy times appear in dark blue, tentative times are outlined in light blue, and free time shows as white. If someone is working remotely, their time slots are shown with a dotted pattern. Non-working hours appear greyed out, and if someone is fully marked as out of office, you’ll see purple dotted blocks.

If a colleague has shared their full calendar with you, you’ll see more detailed information—like the titles of their events. If not, Outlook will simply show basic free or busy status.

Now, when you're looking for the best time to meet, there are a few ways to go about it.

First, you can scroll through the timeline view and manually find a time slot that works for everyone. This is helpful if you already have a rough idea of when you want to meet and just need to double-check availability.

Second, take a look at the Suggested Times panel on the right-hand side. Outlook automatically recommends time slots where all required attendees are available, based on the duration of the meeting. If you don’t see the Suggested Times panel, try clicking the Room Finder button in the ribbon. This usually brings up the panel on the right, where suggested time slots will appear automatically.

And third, you can let Outlook do the work for you by using AutoPick. You’ll find it in the ribbon within the Scheduling Assistant view. Just click the dropdown, choose whether you want to include optional attendees or only required ones, and Outlook will automatically jump to the next best available time for the group.

I have to admit—I only recently discovered the AutoPick feature in Outlook Calendar. But ever since, I’ve been using it regularly, especially when I need to find a time slot that works for several or a whole group of participants. It’s been surprisingly helpful for coordinating with busy colleagues, and it takes a lot of the guesswork out of scheduling.

That said, one quick word of caution: all these features—including the Scheduling Assistant, Suggested Times, and AutoPick—only work with people inside your organization. That’s because Outlook needs access to their calendar data to show availability. If you add someone from outside your company, you’ll just see a blank space for their schedule. So while these tools are incredibly useful, they work best when you're scheduling internally.
