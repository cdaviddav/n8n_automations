# Outlook Calendar: Reuse Events Fast: Copy, Paste & Forward Meetings
Let’s move on and talk about a simple way to save time when setting up meetings—by reusing ones you’ve already created.

Recurring updates, follow-ups, or status calls don’t have to be scheduled from scratch every time. With just a few clicks, you can copy, paste, or forward an existing event—saving time, reducing errors, and keeping your calendar clean and consistent.

One of the simplest time-savers is just to copy and paste an existing meeting.
In your calendar, click on any meeting or appointment, then press Ctrl + C to copy it. Click on a different time slot and press Ctrl + V to paste it. You can do this right in the calendar grid—no need to open the meeting first.

If you prefer using your mouse, you can also right-click the event, choose Copy, then right-click on the new time slot and select Paste. Once it’s in place, just double-click to open the new version and adjust the details if needed—like changing the date, time, or agenda.

I use this all the time for follow-up calls or one-off check-ins that don’t happen on a regular schedule. It saves you from retyping the meeting details or re-adding all the attendees manually.

Just one thing to watch out for: after pasting, make sure to open the new meeting and click Send. Until you do, it only appears on your calendar—your invitees won’t be notified.

Now let’s look at forwarding a meeting.
Sometimes you don’t want to create a new meeting—you just want to share an existing one with someone else. In that case, open the meeting, then click on Forward in the top left corner or just right click on the meeting and click forward. You can choose Forward as iCalendar or simply Forward depending on your Outlook version. I usually just chose to forward the meeting. 

When you forward a meeting, Outlook sends that person a copy of the invite, but they won’t be added to the meeting automatically. That means you can share the meeting details without changing the original attendee list. 

A quick note here—if you want to officially add someone to a meeting, it’s better to open the meeting and update the attendee list so Outlook can track responses and availability. 

In practice, forwarding a meeting is especially useful when you’re not the meeting organizer. If you want to include someone else in a meeting but don’t have permission to update the attendee list, forwarding is a quick way to share the invite without needing to ask the organizer to add them manually.

One thing to keep in mind: when you forward a meeting that someone else created, the organizer will get a notification showing who you forwarded it to. So it’s not entirely silent.

Also worth noting is 	when you forward a meeting, the person you add will get the invite, but they won’t receive future updates unless the organizer manually adds them to the attendee list. So it works fine for one-off shares, but if someone needs to stay in the loop, it’s better to have them officially added.
