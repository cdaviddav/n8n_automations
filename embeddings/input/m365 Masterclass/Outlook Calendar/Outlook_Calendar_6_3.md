# Outlook Calendar: Know Who’s Coming: Track Meeting Responses
Let’s say you’ve sent out a meeting invite—but now you’re wondering: who’s actually joining?

In busy teams, it’s not uncommon for some people to accept, some to decline, and others to forget to respond altogether. Instead of chasing people down or guessing, Outlook makes it easy to track meeting responses directly from the calendar invite.

To check responses, just open the meeting from your calendar. There is a separate Tracking tab at the top, where you’ll see a full list of everyone invited, along with their response: Accepted, Declined, Tentative, or No Response. It updates automatically as people reply.

This is especially helpful if you’re preparing for a session and want to know who’ll be in the room—or if you need to follow up with someone who hasn’t responded yet. I often glance at this the day before a meeting to make sure key people are confirmed.

And here’s a small detail that matters: if someone accepts the invite without sending a response, they’ll be marked as “None” in the tracking view. That means their status looks blank, even if the meeting is on their calendar. So if you’re organizing something important, it’s a good idea to encourage attendees to always send their responses.

One great thing about the tracking feature is that it doesn’t just work for meetings you’ve organized. You can also see attendee responses for any meeting in your calendar, even if someone else sent the invite. So whether you're the host or just a participant, you can still check who’s attending and who hasn’t responded yet—right from the same place.
