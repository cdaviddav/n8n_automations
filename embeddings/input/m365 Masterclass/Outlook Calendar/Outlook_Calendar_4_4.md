# Outlook Calendar: Breathe Between Meetings: Add Buffer Time
Next up, let’s talk about how to avoid back-to-back burnout by adding buffer time into your calendar.

Even with a well-planned schedule, it’s easy to get stuck in non-stop meetings—leaving no time to take a breath, grab a coffee, or simply switch gears. Adding small breaks between meetings can make your day feel more manageable, and Outlook has built-in features that help you do just that.

By default, Outlook sets meetings to 30 or 60 minutes, but let’s be honest—shorter meetings are often just as effective, especially when there’s a clear agenda. One of the easiest ways to build in buffer time is to shorten these default lengths automatically.

To set this up, go to the File tab, click Options, then select Calendar. Under Calendar options, check the box that says “Shorten appointments and meetings.” You can choose how much time to cut—usually five minutes for shorter meetings and maybe ten minutes for longer ones. So, for example, instead of 10:00 to 10:30, Outlook will now suggest 10:00 to 10:25 by default when setting up the meeting.

It might sound small, but those few minutes give you time to breathe, finish up notes, or prep for what’s next. I’ve been using this for a while now, and it really helps. People usually appreciate when meetings end a little earlier, and you avoid that scrambled feeling of jumping straight into the next call.

While you’re in the same settings pane, it’s also a good time to check your default reminders.
Outlook usually sets a 15-minute reminder before every meeting—and honestly, that works well for most people. I keep it at the default too, simply because everyone’s used to it. If you change it, there’s a chance others might show up too early or too late, expecting that standard 15-minute nudge. So unless you have a specific reason to adjust it, sticking with the default tends to work best.
