# Find Anything Instantly: Use Teams Search
Next up, let’s discover how to use the search bar in Microsoft Teams to quickly find messages, files, people, and even commands—so you spend less time scrolling and more time getting things done.

Because let’s be honest: we all have that moment where we remember someone said something important... but we have no clue where the message is or which channel it was in. The longer you use Teams, the more that pile of messages and files grows—and without search, it’s easy to waste time just digging around.

You’ll find the search bar right at the top of your Teams window. You can click into it, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + E to jump straight there.

Let’s say you’re trying to find a message where someone mentioned a deadline. Just type in a keyword—like “Friday” or “launch”—and press Enter. You’ll see results grouped into Messages, People, Files, Group Chats and Teams and Channels. If you remember who said it, you can narrow it down by clicking the Filters icon and filtering by sender, date, or even the specific Team or Channel. This is super helpful when you don’t want to scroll through weeks of unrelated messages.

If you’re looking for a file, type in a few words from the document name or file content. Teams will show results from chats, channels, and even files stored in connected OneDrive or SharePoint locations. You don’t need to remember exactly where it was saved—search will bring it to you.

You can also search for people. Just start typing a name, and Teams will suggest matches right away. You can then click on the person to open a chat or view their contact card.

Now here’s a trick I use all the time: the search bar also doubles as a command bar. Try typing a slash—just a single forward slash—and you’ll see a list of available commands. For example, type slash and then “call” to start a call with someone, or slash and “dnd” to set your status to Do Not Disturb. You can also use “/unread” to instantly jump to all your unread activity, which is a great way to quickly catch up.

If you type the at symbol—@—you can quickly access apps or find people you’ve interacted with recently. It’s a small detail, but it really helps when you’re working fast and want to avoid hunting around manually.
