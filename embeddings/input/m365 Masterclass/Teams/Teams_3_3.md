# Edit Together: Collaborate on Files in Teams
Let’s move and see how to share, co-edit, and manage files directly in Teams—so you can stop emailing attachments back and forth and keep all your work in one place.

One of the best things about Microsoft Teams is that it doesn’t just support communication—it also brings your documents and collaboration into the same space. But here’s the catch: a lot of people still download files, edit them locally, and then re-upload or email the new version. It’s messy, it’s slow, and it defeats the purpose of using Teams.

So let’s fix that and look at how to collaborate properly on files, right inside Teams.

You can share files in two main places: inside a chat or inside a channel. If you're in a chat, just click the plus icon next to the message box and select "Attach file." You can upload something from your device, link a file from OneDrive, or simply drag and drop a file directly into the chat.

Once you send it, everyone in the chat can open the file—and by default, it will open directly within Teams. For example, if you share a PowerPoint presentation, it opens right in the PowerPoint app inside Teams. If you prefer to use the desktop version, you have two options: either click the pen icon once the file is open in Teams and select “Open in desktop app,” or click the three dots next to the file in the chat and choose “Open in desktop.”

The best part is that everyone works on the same cloud version of the file—no duplicates, no confusion, just one shared document that’s always up to date. Multiple people can edit at the same time, and you’ll see changes instantly. I use this all the time with Word or Excel files, especially for reports or task lists where input from several people is needed.

Now let’s talk about where these files are stored. Any file shared in a chat is automatically saved to the OneDrive of the person who uploaded it, in a folder called “Microsoft Teams Chat Files.” Everyone in the chat is granted access to view or edit, but the original uploader remains the file owner.

If you want to revisit shared files, you don’t need to scroll back through the conversation. Just open the chat, go to the Shared tab at the top, and you’ll see a full list of everything shared in that thread. From there, you can open, download, or manage the files directly.

If you’re sharing a file in a channel, it works almost the same. You can either drop it into a message in the Posts tab, or go directly to the Files tab in that channel and upload it there. Every file shared in a channel is automatically stored in SharePoint, and everyone who’s part of the team has access to it. That makes it the best option when you’re working on something that the whole group needs to see or contribute to.

One thing to keep in mind: if you're uploading a file that only certain people should have access to, it's better to share it via a chat or OneDrive link instead of dropping it into a channel. Channel files are open to everyone in the team by default.
