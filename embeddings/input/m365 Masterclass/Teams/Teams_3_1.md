# Communicate Clearly: Chats vs. Channels
First of all, let’s discuss when to use Chats and when to use Channels—so your communication stays clear, organized, and easy to follow.

Communication in Teams can quickly become confusing—especially if you’re not sure when to use a chat and when to post in a channel. It’s one of the most common mistakes and an easy one to fix once you know the difference.

So let’s break it down.

Chats are great for quick, informal communication. Think of them like direct messages—perfect for asking a question, sharing a file, or clearing something up in real time. You can message individuals or set up group chats for small teams or quick back-and-forths. Personally, I spend most of my time in chats—discussing projects, checking in with team members, or just getting something clarified without the formality of an email.

You can also start a call directly from any chat. Just click the video icon in the top right corner. If you click the dropdown, you can choose whether to start a video or audio call—it’s fast and doesn’t require setting up a meeting.

In short, chats should be your go-to for everyday communication—especially when you need a quick response or a casual exchange.

Channels, on the other hand, are designed for transparency and shared context. This is where you post updates, decisions, or questions that the whole team should be aware of—even if it’s not immediately relevant to everyone. Communication in channels happens through posts and comments. The format itself is more structured—think of it like a shared noticeboard where important information is documented.

You can start a new post or reply to an existing one, but overall, channels are more formal and intentional than chats. While chats are fast and two-way, channels are better suited for keeping the team aligned and maintaining a clear, searchable record of key topics.

Also, remember that in channels, you can reply directly to a post so the conversation stays in one thread. In chats, it’s a back-and-forth like any messaging app. This small difference makes a big impact when it comes to staying organized.

Here’s a simple way to think about it: if your message needs to be part of a bigger conversation that others might need to see or contribute to later—use a channel. If it’s just between you and one or two people and doesn’t need to be seen by others—use chat.

Another thing to keep in mind is visibility. When you post in a chat, only the people in that thread can see it. When you post in a channel, everyone in the team has access. That means if you want something to stay visible, searchable, and part of the shared knowledge base, the channel is the better place.
