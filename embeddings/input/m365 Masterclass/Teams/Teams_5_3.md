# Organize Notes: Add OneNote to Teams
Now, in this video, you’ll learn how to integrate OneNote directly into Teams—so you can keep project documentation, meeting notes, or other essential information right where everyone meets.

One of the most common issues I see is that notes are scattered—some in notebooks, some in Word docs, others in emails. Even with digital tools, it’s easy to lose track of where things are saved or forget where that one important point from last week’s meeting went. The solution? Keep your notes connected to your teamwork—and OneNote inside Teams does exactly that.

Let’s say you’re working in a specific Team or Channel and you want to add a shared notebook that everyone can access. Go to the channel where the notebook should live, then click the plus icon at the top of the screen to add a new tab. From the list of apps, select OneNote.

Teams will then prompt you to either create a new notebook or link to an existing one. If your team already has a shared notebook in use—maybe for meeting notes or documentation—you can simply search and select it. Otherwise, choose to create a new notebook directly from this view.

Once added, the OneNote tab becomes part of your channel, and everyone in the team can access it without switching apps. So, the notebook you add in Teams functions just like any other OneNote notebook. You can create sections, add pages, and edit content as usual. If you want more control, click the small dropdown arrow next to the notebook’s name in the ribbon. From there, you can take additional actions like renaming the notebook, opening it in a separate window, or managing permissions.

In many teams I’ve worked with, OneNote in Teams is often used to store evergreen or static information—things the team regularly refers back to. It works really well as a central knowledge hub where anyone can quickly look something up, check procedures, or review shared resources without digging through files or emails.

If you’re using OneNote across multiple Teams or want quick access, you can also pin the OneNote app to your sidebar. Just click the three dots in the left sidebar, search for OneNote, and pin it. This gives you access to all your notebooks across Teams and OneDrive in one central place.

By the way, if you are wondering where the notebook is stored, it resides in the SharePoint site associated with the Teams channel. Each team in Microsoft Teams has a dedicated SharePoint site where channel files and data are organized within the "Documents" library. When you add a OneNote notebook to a channel, it is automatically saved in a folder named after the channel within that library.

To access the SharePoint site for your team, open Microsoft Teams and go to the team and channel where the notebook was added. Click on the Files tab at the top of the channel, and then select the option to open in SharePoint. This will take you directly to the SharePoint site associated with your team. Once there, navigate to the Documents library and find the folder named after the channel. The notebook will be stored in that folder, ensuring all shared content is centralized and easy to find.
