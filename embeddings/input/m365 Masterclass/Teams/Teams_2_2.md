# Work Smarter: Customize Teams for Your Workflow
Now that you know your way around the layout, it’s time to take the next step—making Teams your own. One of the biggest pain points for users is the feeling that Teams can be noisy or cluttered. With so many chats, channels, and notifications flying around, it can start to feel like you’re working in the middle of a busy street. But the truth is, you can dial it down, clean it up, and set up Teams to work the way you work.

Let’s start with the sidebar. If you haven’t done this already, try dragging and dropping the icons on the left to rearrange them. For now, let’s stick with the default order—Activity, Chat, Teams, Calendar, and so on—so we’re all working from the same layout in this module. Later on, you can customize it however you like. If there’s a section you rarely use, just right-click on the icon and choose “Unpin” to keep things clean and focused.

In the latest version of Teams, you also have the option to customize how your Chat and Teams views are displayed. To try it out, go to either the Chat or Teams section and click the three little dots at the top of the sidebar. Then select “	customize view”

This opens a settings menu where you can choose to combine chats, teams, and channels into a single, streamlined view. If you enable this, the separate Teams tab will disappear, and everything will now appear under Chat. At the top of the sidebar, you’ll get filters that let you quickly switch between unread messages, channels, chats, or meeting chats—all in one place.

This setup removes one item from the left-hand navigation and brings all your written communication together. It’s a nice way to reduce visual clutter if you like having everything in one feed.

Personally, I prefer to keep Chats and Teams separate—it helps me stay mentally organized and gives each space a distinct function. But it really comes down to what works best for you. If you want to switch back, just return to “Customize view” and select “Separate.”

While you're in the same menu, take a moment to review your chat and channel settings. You can tweak things like message density, suggested replies, or whether you want to show message previews—small changes that can make your daily experience smoother.

To access the main settings in Teams, click on the three little dots next to your profile picture or initials in the top-right corner, then select Settings. One of the most important sections to look at first is Notifications—because if you don’t set these up properly, Teams can quickly become a source of constant distraction.

In the Notifications section, you can decide how and when Teams should alert you. By default, there are quite a few settings that may not match your preferences. I recommend going through them one by one and adjusting them to reduce noise and stay focused. You can change notification sounds, choose whether alerts show as banners or just in your feed, and even fine-tune how you’re notified for different events—like replies, mentions, reactions, or new posts in channels.

While you’re in the settings menu, head over to the Privacy tab. One option I highly recommend turning on is “Mute notifications while sharing your screen.” This prevents distracting pop-ups when you’re presenting—honestly, it should be on by default, but it’s worth double-checking.

For other availability settings, click on your profile picture. Here you can manually set your status to Available, Busy, Do Not Disturb, and so on. If you don’t update it manually, Teams will sync your status from Outlook—so your availability reflects your calendar. Green means you’re available, yellow if you’ve been inactive, red if you’re in a meeting, purple for out-of-office, and red with a white bar if you’re presenting.

Now let’s look at Appearance. Back in Settings, go to the “Appearance and Accessibility” section. You can choose to follow your system settings or select a theme manually—light, dark, classic, or high contrast. I personally use dark mode; it’s easier on the eyes, especially if you’re jumping between apps all day.

There’s also an option to switch between default and compact layout. I stick with the default, but if you want to see more messages or threads at once, compact might work better for you. It’s a small change, but it can make a real difference in how comfortable the interface feels.

Of course, these aren’t all the settings available—but they are some of the most impactful ones. If you want to go deeper, take a bit of time to explore the other settings and tweak Teams to match your preferences. A few thoughtful adjustments can make the whole app feel calmer, cleaner, and a lot more helpful.
