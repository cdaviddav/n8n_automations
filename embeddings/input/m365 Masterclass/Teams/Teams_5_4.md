# Collaborate in Real Time: Launch Loop from Teams
Next up: we’ll learn how to collaborate live by launching Microsoft Loop directly from Teams—so you can brainstorm, plan, and create with your team without breaking your flow or switching between different apps.

We all know how frustrating it can be when you're trying to work with others—chasing the latest file version, trying to remember decisions made in chat, or constantly moving between tools just to keep everyone updated. That’s exactly where Microsoft Loop shines, and the good news is, you can integrate it fully inside Teams to create a much smoother experience.

When it comes to using Loop inside Teams, there are several ways to set it up. In fact, you have four main options: you can embed full Loop pages or workspaces into chats and channels, use Loop components directly in conversations, access your Loop workspaces through the Loop app in the Teams sidebar, and use Loop components to collaborate on live meeting notes.

Now let’s start with embedding entire Loop pages or workspaces in Teams, but this use case varies, depending on whether you're working in a Teams chat or a Teams channel.

Let’s start with the first option: integrating Loop into Teams chats, meaning conversations with one or more individuals.
It is possible to embed a Loop workspace or page within a Teams chat, but it’s not natively supported yet. Instead, we can use a simple workaround. When you're in a chat, click the plus icon at the top of the screen to add a new tab. From there, you won’t find Loop listed directly. Instead, select Website as the tab type. This opens a pop-up where you can define a tab name and paste the URL of the Loop page or workspace you want to embed.

If you want to add a single Loop page, first copy the page URL. To do that, either right-click the page name in the left navigation bar inside Loop and select Copy page link, or open the page, click the Share button in the top-right corner, and select Page link. A pop-up will confirm the link has been copied to your clipboard.

Now, paste that URL into the Website tab URL field in Teams and click Save. A new tab will appear in your chat, and clicking it will open the specific Loop page directly in your browser.

If instead you want to add an entire Loop workspace, the process is similar. Inside Loop, navigate to any page within the workspace, click the Share button, select Workspace, and then Copy link. Back in Teams, paste this link into the Website tab URL field. After saving, the tab will open the full Loop workspace, allowing you and your chat participants to collaborate across multiple pages.

Now let’s move on to the second option: integrating Loop into Teams channels.
When you're in a channel, click the plus icon in the ribbon to add a new tab. Here, unlike in a chat, you can directly select Loop from the list of apps. Select Loop, click Save, and you’ll be prompted to create a new workspace.

You can either give your workspace a name and click Create to set it up immediately, or you can click Add content before creating it. If you choose to add content, you can select existing Loop components, files, or pages you want to include right from the start. Once you’ve made your selection, click Create, and your shared workspace will be ready inside the Teams channel.

The new workspace will open with the added pages listed on the left-hand side, and you can start collaborating just as you would in the Loop app—adding new pages, using templates, inserting text, tables, task lists, and other content blocks.

And just like with any other workspace created in Loop, once the workspace is set up through Teams, it will also appear in your Loop app under your list of workspaces. All content stays perfectly synced live, whether you access it from Teams, the Loop app, or your browser.

Now besides adding full Loop pages or workspaces, you can also work with Loop components right inside any chat or conversation in Teams.

Loop components are small, editable blocks—like bullet lists, checklists, tables, or paragraph sections—that everyone can update in real time.
To add a Loop component, simply go to the message box in a chat or channel, click the Loop icon, and pick the type of component you want to insert. Once added, everyone in the chat or channel can jump in and start editing immediately.

The best part is that Loop components stay live no matter where they’re shared—Teams, Outlook, or Loop itself. You can even interact with the component directly: click the people icon to see who has access, or use the copy icon to reuse the component in other chats or emails without breaking the live connection.

There’s also a See all locations link you can click, which opens the component in your Loop app, showing you everywhere it’s been shared and giving you a bigger workspace to continue editing or organizing your content.

If you want to go even further, you can open the Loop app directly inside Teams from the sidebar.
This is great if you want access to all your Loop workspaces without leaving the Teams environment. It’s especially useful if Loop is where you do most of your planning, project tracking, or shared documentation.

To get started, click the three-dot menu in the left-hand Teams sidebar, search for Loop, and open it. If you plan to use it often, right-click the icon and choose Pin so it stays easily accessible. When you open Loop inside Teams, you’ll see a familiar interface: your personal workspaces at the top, followed by a list of your components below. You can also filter for meeting notes, favorites, or search by keyword.

Clicking on any item will open it in your browser, just like in the Loop app. It’s not a separate version—it’s simply a convenient way to access all your Loop content without switching windows.

Finally, another great way to use Loop inside Teams is for live meeting notes—so action items actually get captured and followed up. It’s less about the use of just one tool, like Loop, but more about a smart three-way integration between Outlook, Teams, and Loop.

The key is to create the meeting directly from your Teams calendar, not from Outlook. This small tweak matters because it lets you embed a Loop component into the meeting invite—giving you a shared space for agenda items, live notes, and follow-up tasks.

When scheduling a meeting in Teams, after filling in the title, attendees, and time, you’ll see an option at the bottom to “Add an agenda.” Clicking it automatically inserts a Loop component with three sections: Agenda, Meeting Notes, and Follow-up Tasks. You can fill this out before sending the invite, and everyone will receive it with full context.

During the meeting, you’ll find the notes under the Notes tab at the top of the Teams window. Everyone can contribute live—adding discussion points, decisions, or assigning tasks—and those tasks sync instantly to Planner and To Do. It’s a seamless way to keep everything connected without needing follow-up emails.

Just a quick note: this feature only works when you schedule and open the meeting through the Teams calendar. If you open the invite from Outlook, the Loop component won’t show up.

After the meeting, you can easily revisit the notes by opening the meeting in your Teams calendar, or by browsing Meeting Notes in the Loop app.
