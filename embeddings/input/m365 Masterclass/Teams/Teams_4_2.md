# Run Better Meetings: Tips for Engagement
Next up: In this video, you’ll learn how to use two powerful tools in Microsoft Teams—Breakout Rooms and the Whiteboard—to make your meetings more interactive, especially when you're working with larger groups or need a creative space for collaboration.

Let’s start with Breakout Rooms. These are ideal when you want participants to break into smaller groups to brainstorm, discuss a topic, or work on something in parallel. It’s especially useful in workshops, training sessions, or team meetings where group input matters.

To set up breakout rooms, start your meeting as usual. Once you're in, click the Rooms icon in the top toolbar. You’ll be asked how many rooms you want to create and whether you want Teams to assign people automatically or do it manually. I usually go with automatic if the groups don’t need to be specific, but manual gives you full control if you need to group people intentionally.

After the rooms are created, you can open them all at once or one at a time. Participants are notified and moved into their assigned rooms, and as the meeting organizer, you can jump between rooms to check in on the conversations. You can also send announcements that pop up for everyone in the breakout rooms—this is helpful if you want to give them a time check or ask them to return to the main meeting.

When the discussion is over, you just click “Close rooms,” and everyone is automatically brought back into the main meeting. It’s simple, and it breaks up the passive meeting format with real interaction.

Now let’s look at the Whiteboard feature. This is great when you need a shared space to sketch out ideas, brainstorm, or map something visually with your team.

To open the Whiteboard during a meeting, click the Share button, scroll down, and select Microsoft Whiteboard. This will launch a collaborative space that everyone in the meeting can see. Depending on your settings, you might see a template selection page—feel free to pick a template to get started or just open a blank canvas.

Once you're in, you can draw, type, add sticky notes, and use ready-made layouts like Kanban boards or brainstorming templates. I often use it in project kick-offs or planning sessions when we want to map out ideas visually without getting stuck in long explanations.

If you’d like to adjust settings—like who can edit or whether participant names are shown—you can do that via the gear icon in the top right corner. To stop sharing the whiteboard, just click the button stop sharing at the top of the screen.

You can also choose to share the Whiteboard link before the meeting ends, but don’t worry if you forget—it’s saved automatically. After the meeting, you can access it anytime through the Whiteboard app in Teams or at whiteboard.microsoft.com, which makes it easy to continue where you left off or share it with people who missed the meeting.
