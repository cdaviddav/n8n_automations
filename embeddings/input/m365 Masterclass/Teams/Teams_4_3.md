# Capture Every Detail: Record & Transcribe Meetings
Now, let’s look at how to record and transcribe your Teams meetings, so you never lose important discussions—even if someone couldn’t join live or if you need to revisit decisions later.

Sometimes you're in a meeting and can’t take detailed notes while keeping up with the discussion. Or someone’s out sick, and you need to bring them up to speed without repeating the whole thing. Recording and transcription can take that pressure off. It gives you a complete, searchable reference you can revisit or share, without relying on memory or manual note-taking.

Let’s start with how to record a meeting. Once you’re in the call, click on the three dots in the meeting toolbar to open the More menu, then select Record and transcribe. You’ll be prompted to choose the language the meeting will be held in before starting either feature.

You can choose to start the recording, the transcription, or both. If you start a recording, transcription will usually begin automatically as well. You can stop either one at any time by going back into the same Record and transcribe menu and selecting Stop recording or Stop transcription.

Everyone in the meeting will see a notification that recording has started, so it’s fully transparent. Depending on your organization’s settings, participants may also be asked to confirm their consent—usually by clicking a button that enables their microphone or camera again, since both may be automatically turned off when the recording begins. From that moment on, everything said and shown on screen will be captured.

If you just want to transcribe without recording video, that’s possible too. Go to the same menu and select Start transcription. The transcript will appear in real time on the right-hand side of the screen, and you can follow along as people speak. It even identifies speakers automatically, so you know who said what.

The recording will be stored in OneDrive or SharePoint, depending on where the meeting took place. If it was a regular calendar meeting, the recording is saved to the organizer’s OneDrive. If the meeting was hosted in a channel, it’s saved to that channel’s SharePoint. Either way, the file will show up in the meeting chat for everyone to access afterward.

The transcript is also available in the meeting chat. You can open it, scroll through, or download it for reference. It’s especially helpful when you want to find something someone said without rewatching the whole meeting. Just use the search function to jump to the exact moment.

Keep in mind that not all organizations have recording and transcription enabled by default. If you don’t see these options in your meeting controls, it’s worth checking with your IT admin to see if the features are available in your setup.

Personally, I find this feature incredibly useful and have relied on it many times. One of the best things is that even if you miss a meeting but were invited, you can simply open the meeting chat afterward. You’ll find the recording, transcript, and any shared content right there—no need to chase down notes or ask someone to recap.
