# Navigate Easily: Explore the Teams Layout
First of all, let’s get familiar with the layout of Microsoft Teams so you always know where to go and what to click. Understanding the structure of the app is key to using it with confidence—and once it’s no longer a maze, you can focus on getting work done instead of figuring out where everything lives.

For many people, Teams feels overwhelming at first. There’s a lot happening: chat messages, files, meetings, channels—and it’s easy to get lost if you’re new. So let’s dive in and help you gain clarity to move faster, not slower.

When you first open Microsoft Teams, the most important thing to understand is that the app is divided into two main areas: the left sidebar and the main window.

The sidebar on the left is your navigation panel. This is where you switch between core functions—like Activity, Chat, Teams, Calendar, Calls, and Files. Depending on how your company has set things up, you might also see other apps here like Approvals, OneNote, Planner, or even third-party tools.

You can click on any of these icons to open the corresponding section. Personally, I’ve kept the default order—starting with Activity at the top, followed by Chat, Teams, Calendar, and so on. To keep things simple, we’ll stick with this default layout for the rest of the module so we’re all working from the same setup.

That said, you’re not stuck with this order. If something feels off, you can easily rearrange the icons by dragging and dropping them in the sidebar.

You can also customize what’s visible. Click on the three little dots at the bottom of the sidebar to access a list of additional apps. This includes both built-in Microsoft tools and third-party integrations. You can select from the suggested ones or click “Apps” to explore even more options.

For now, let’s add the Planner app together. Click the three dots, find Planner in the list, and open it. Once it’s open, right-click on the icon in the sidebar and select “Pin” to keep it there permanently. That way, your most-used tools are always just one click away.

The main window changes depending on what you’ve selected from the sidebar. So, if you click on Chat, this space shows your recent conversations. If you click on Teams, it shows your list of Teams and channels. You’re basically telling Teams what you want to work on—and it adjusts accordingly.

Let’s briefly review all the different views so you know what’s behind those little icons:

First, there’s the Activity view. This shows you all the recent activity that’s relevant to you—mentions, replies, reactions, invites and other updates across Teams and channels you’re part of. It’s basically your notification center inside Teams.

Then, there’s Chat. This is where you’ll find your one-on-one and group conversations that aren’t tied to a specific team or channel. It’s great for quick communication, file sharing, or informal collaboration outside the structured team spaces.

Next is Teams. Here, you’ll see all the teams and channels you’re part of. This is where structured collaboration happens: discussions, files, meetings, and shared apps all live in one place organized by topic or project.

The Calendar view is fully integrated with your Outlook calendar. It basically mirrors your Outlook calendar and you can schedule, join, or manage your meetings from here without switching between apps. It’s especially useful for quickly jumping into a call or seeing your availability at a glance.

Then there’s Calls. If your organization has enabled calling features, this is where you can make and receive voice or video calls directly in Teams. You’ll also find your contacts, call history, and voicemail here.

OneDrive gives you direct access to your personal cloud storage. It’s where your private files live—the ones you haven’t yet shared in a team or channel. From here, you can upload, organize, and share files when needed.

And finally, there’s Planner, which we just added. This gives you a visual way to manage tasks within Teams using boards, buckets, and assignments. If you’re part of a project team or managing tasks across multiple people, Planner is a great tool to keep things organized and moving forward.

Each of these views plays a different role, and together they create a streamlined workspace for communication, collaboration, and getting your daily work done. That said, I’ll be honest—I rarely use the OneDrive or Calls view myself. I usually access my personal files directly through File Explorer, so there’s not much need to open OneDrive in Teams. And when it comes to calls, I tend to stick with scheduled meetings or quick chats instead. It really comes down to what works best for your workflow.

Here’s a simple tip to navigate even faster inside Teams. If you’re working within a team and want to jump to a specific channel, just click on the team name to expand it, then select the channel you need. But here’s the trick—if there are channels you use all the time, you don’t need to go digging for them every day. Hover over the channel name, click the three dots, and choose “Pin” or “Show in favorites,” depending on your Teams version. This adds the channel to the top section of your Teams list, so it’s always right there. I do this for my top three project channels, and it saves me from clicking through folders every time.

Another handy tip: you can pop out chats into separate windows. Just hover over a chat in your list, click the three dots in the top-right corner, and select “Open in new window.” I use this all the time—especially during longer conversations—so I can keep the chat open while checking something in another thread or working in a channel. It’s a small change, but it makes Teams feel much more flexible and less cramped.

Now, let’s look up—literally. At the very top of the screen, you’ll find the search bar, but it’s way more powerful than just searching, which we’ll cover in one of the following lessons.

And finally, look to the top right corner of your screen. Behind your profile picture or initials, that’s where your profile lives. From there, you can update your availability—like switching from Available to Do Not Disturb—or access your settings to tweak notifications, themes, and more.

You can also access your settings by clicking the three little dots next to your profile picture in the top-right corner. But don’t worry—we’ll dive into how to customize Teams to fit your workflow in the next lesson.
