# Plan & Track: Use To Do and Planner in Teams
Next up, let’s look at how to track and manage personal and team tasks inside Microsoft Teams using To Do and Planner—so you can stay on top of everything without jumping between different tools.

Let’s start with a quick overview, because the integration isn’t immediately obvious. In fact, Microsoft To Do isn’t available as a standalone app inside Teams. But no worries—everything you need is available through the Planner app, which brings your personal tasks and team projects together in one place. Thanks to the seamless sync across Microsoft 365, Planner pulls in your To Do tasks, flagged emails, and shared plans so you can manage everything from a single view right inside Teams.

To get started, go to the sidebar in Teams, click the three dots, search for Planner, and open the app. I recommend right-clicking and selecting Pin so it stays in your sidebar and is always easy to access. Once you open Planner, you'll land on a clean dashboard that brings everything together—your personal tasks, shared team plans, assigned tasks, and even flagged emails from Outlook—all in one place.

Without diving too deep into the Planner app—since we’ll cover it in detail in the dedicated Planner module par of this course—let me give you a quick walkthrough of the main parts of the app, just so you can get oriented.

On the left, you’ll see the sidebar, which gives you a clear overview of everything at a glance. The My Day section shows tasks you’ve intentionally added for focus today—this is great if you want to start your day with a clean, curated list. Below that, My Tasks collects all your personal tasks, including things from ToDo, tasks you created manually, or those that came in from flagged emails in Outlook. And finally, there’s My Plans, which brings in all your shared task boards—these are your team projects and collaborative workspaces created through Planner in Teams.

As I mentioned earlier, what makes this so powerful is that Planner pulls together tasks from across your entire Microsoft 365 ecosystem. Tasks from To Do, flagged emails from Outlook, and collaborative tasks from Planner all show up here in one unified view. The sync works both ways—if you create a task in To Do, it’ll show up in Planner. If you flag an email in Outlook, it’s routed through To Do and ends up in Planner as well. And if you’re assigned a task in a Planner board, you’ll see it right here too.

That said, there’s one important thing to keep in mind: only shared task properties sync across apps. Things like the task title, due date, and completion status will follow you wherever you go. But more detailed fields that are unique to a specific app—like task progress tracking or labels in Planner—might not carry over to To Do or Outlook. So while everything connects, not all features are fully mirrored. Just something to be aware of as you start working more across these tools.

In addition to using the Planner app directly within Teams, let’s take a look at how Planner also shows up in other areas across Teams—making it easy to access and manage tasks right where the work is already happening.

When you're working in a team channel, you can add a Planner board as a tab. Just open the channel, click the plus icon at the top, choose Planner, and create a new plan or connect to an existing one. Creating a new plan is straightforward—you can either start from scratch or choose from a selection of templates to get up and running quickly.

However, when you're adding an existing plan to a Teams channel, there’s one important thing to be aware of: Teams will only show you plans that are already connected to the Microsoft 365 group associated with that specific Team. That means if you try to add a plan that wasn’t created under the same group, it won’t appear in the dropdown when you're trying to link it to the channel.

To avoid this, make sure that when you create a new plan, you associate it with the correct Microsoft 365 group. You’ll see this option during the setup process in Planner—just select the group that matches your Team. If the plan is linked to the right group from the start, it will automatically appear as an option when adding an existing plan to a Teams channel.

If you already have a plan that wasn’t linked to a group but now you’d like to use it in a channel, you can still fix that. Open the plan in Planner, click the Share button in the top-right corner, and select Add to an existing group. Choose the group connected to your Team, and once that’s done, the plan will be available in the dropdown when adding a Planner tab to your channel.

Once the plan is added to the channel, everyone in the Team can view and collaborate on it directly within the same workspace. It’s a simple but powerful way to keep tasks and conversations connected—no switching between apps, no lost context.

Now you might wonder what the difference between a group and a plan is. In Teams, a group refers to the Microsoft 365 group that backs the teams. Just to recap, a Team is the top-level structure in Microsoft Teams, and channels are the spaces within each Team where specific conversations and content are organized. So the team includes all team members and determines access to shared resources like the Planner plan, OneDrive files, and SharePoint site. Anyone added to the team is automatically part of the group.

A channel, on the other hand, is a subsection within the team. For standard channels, everyone in the group, meaning all team members, has access by default. However, for private channels, you can select specific members from the team to be part of the channel, meaning not all group members have access.

So, for standard channels, the people are essentially the same as those in the group. For private channels, the people may differ, as private channels are restricted to a subset of the group.

You can easily recognize a private channel in Teams by the small lock icon next to its name—that’s your sign that access is restricted to a specific group.

Now let’s take a look at how Planner connects with your day-to-day communication inside Teams. One of the best features is that you can turn a message—whether in a chat or a channel post—into a task without ever leaving the conversation.

To do this, just hover over the message—whether it's in a chat or a channel—then click the three dots to open the message options. From there, go to More actions and select Create Planner task. If you’ve used this option once, “Create Planner task” will show up directly the next time you click the three dots, making the process even faster.

A pop-up window will open where you can fill in the task details—give it a title, set a due date, choose a priority level, add notes, and select the plan or list where it should go. If you're adding it to a shared plan, you can also assign the task to a specific team member. At the bottom, there's an option to automatically post a reply in the conversation confirming the task has been created. If you leave this checked, Teams will generate a follow-up message so everyone knows the task is being tracked.

Once saved, the task appears directly in the Planner app inside Teams—either under My Tasks if it’s for you, or in the shared plan you selected.

I really like this feature because it makes it easy to turn quick chats, requests, or reminders into actionable tasks—without needing to switch tools or risk losing the thread. No copy-pasting, no context-switching, and no more forgotten follow-ups. And since everything stays in sync across Planner, Outlook, and To Do, you’ll always have a complete picture of what needs to get done, wherever you’re working.

Another great way to bring tasks directly into the conversation is by using a Loop task list component. In any chat or channel, just click the Loop icon in the message box and choose Task list. You can immediately start typing out action items, assign them to team members, and set due dates—right there in the flow of the conversation. What’s really useful is that everyone in the chat can contribute. It’s a shared, editable list where teammates can add tasks, update details, or mark things complete in real time.

And these aren’t just static notes—they’re actual Planner tasks, fully connected to the underlying group plan. So whatever you create or change in the Loop component will automatically appear in Planner and in To Do for anyone assigned to those tasks. The sync is seamless, and it helps make sure nothing falls through the cracks after a discussion.

Just keep in mind: Loop task list components do not sync with Outlook. You won’t see them on your Outlook task list or calendar, but they will show up in your Planner board and in the Assigned to me section of To Do if you're the one responsible.

I really like both of these features—turning messages into tasks and using Loop components—because they make it easy to move from conversation to action without switching tools. You don’t lose context, you don’t forget follow-ups, and best of all, your work stays connected across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.
