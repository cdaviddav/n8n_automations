# Schedule Seamlessly: Link Teams with Outlook
In this video, let’s explore how Teams and Outlook work together to simplify scheduling—so you can stop jumping between tools and keep everything in sync.

One of the best things about using Microsoft 365 is how the tools are connected. But a lot of people still treat Outlook and Teams as completely separate apps. The truth is, they’re deeply integrated—and once you understand how to use them together, your scheduling becomes much faster and more efficient.

Let’s start with the basics. As you might know, every time you schedule a meeting in Outlook, you can make it a Teams meeting with one click. When you create a new event in your Outlook calendar, just make sure to click the button Teams Meeting in the ribbon, which automatically adds a Teams link to the invite, so all participants can join with a single click—no extra steps, no separate setup in Teams.

The same goes the other way around. If you schedule a meeting directly in the Teams calendar, it will automatically show up in your Outlook calendar too. That means no double-bookings, and no need to update two calendars separately.

To schedule a meeting in Teams, go to the Calendar tab in the left sidebar and click New Meeting in the top right corner. You can also double-click directly into a time slot on the calendar, which opens the same scheduling window. From there, add a title, invite participants, and set the date and time. If the meeting is linked to a specific team or project, you can choose a channel to host it—or leave it blank to keep it as a private meeting.

Teams also includes a built-in Scheduling Assistant, so you can easily check everyone’s availability without switching over to Outlook. Once the meeting is saved, all participants will automatically receive an Outlook invite with the Teams link included—no extra steps needed.

If the meeting is linked to a channel, the invite will also appear in the Posts tab of that channel. This keeps everything in one place—conversation, files, and meeting history—so you can quickly access the context before or after the call.

You can also view and join your upcoming meetings from both apps. Whether you’re in Outlook or Teams, the calendar view shows exactly the same events. Personally, I like checking my schedule in Outlook at the beginning of the day, but I usually join meetings directly from Teams because it’s faster and automatically opens in the right place.

Another small but helpful feature is the pop-up notification that appears in the bottom-right corner of your screen when someone joins a meeting you’re invited to. It’s a subtle nudge that the meeting has started and a great reminder to jump in—especially if you’ve lost track of time or didn’t hear the initial alert. I find it especially useful when I’m focused on something else but want to avoid joining late.
