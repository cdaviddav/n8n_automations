# Stay Secure: Manage Teams Permissions
Next up: In this video, you’ll learn how to manage permissions in Microsoft Teams—so your workspaces stay organized, secure, and only accessible to the right people.

When you’re collaborating in Teams, it’s easy to assume everyone sees what you see. But not all Teams, channels, or files are created equal. If permissions aren’t set correctly, you might accidentally give access to people who shouldn’t see certain information—or lock others out of something they need. Knowing how to manage permissions gives you full control over who can do what, and helps keep your digital workspace both clean and secure.

Let’s start with Team-level permissions. To check these, go to the Teams tab, hover over the team you want to manage, click the three dots, and choose Manage team. This opens a panel with tabs like Members, Settings, or Analytics.

Under the Members tab, you’ll see a list of everyone in the team. There are two main roles: Owners and Members. Owners can manage the team’s settings, add or remove people, and control permissions. Members can participate, but they can’t change the structure or settings. You can promote someone to owner by clicking the dropdown next to their name and selecting “Owner.” I usually recommend having at least two owners per team, just in case someone is out of office or leaves the organization. To add a member, just click the plus add member button at the top and invite them via their name or email address.

Under the Settings tab, you’ll find more granular controls. Here you can decide whether members can create or delete channels, add apps, or mention the entire team. This is helpful if you want to avoid clutter or limit disruptions in larger teams. For example, I often disable the ability for members to create new channels in client-facing teams to keep things more controlled.

Now let’s talk about channel permissions. By default, every standard channel in a team is visible to all members of that team. But if you need to restrict access, you can create a private channel or a shared channel.

To do this, click the three dots next to the team name, select Add channel, then choose either “Private” or “Shared” in the privacy dropdown. Private channels are only visible to a selected subset of team members. Shared channels are designed for collaboration across different teams or even external guests—if your organization allows that.

Private and shared channels each have their own permissions, separate from the main team. So even if someone is in the team, they won’t see the channel unless they’ve been specifically added to it. This is great for things like leadership discussions, HR topics, or smaller project groups within a larger team.

And finally, let’s touch on file permissions—a detail that’s easy to overlook but incredibly important. In public or shared Teams channels, any files shared are stored in the connected SharePoint site. To manage or fine-tune who can access what, go to the Files tab in the channel, then click Open in SharePoint. From there, you’ll be able to adjust permissions in more detail.

In private chats, on the other hand, shared files are stored in your OneDrive, and permissions can be adjusted from there in a similar way.

I know permissions aren’t the most exciting part—but getting them right upfront helps everything run more smoothly, avoids access issues, and keeps your workspace secure. A little structure here really does save a lot of confusion later on.
