# Meet Confidently: Master the Meeting Interface
First of all, let’s get a clear overview of the Teams meeting interface, so you feel confident running or joining meetings without clicking around in confusion.

We spend so many hours in Teams meetings—it’s worth taking a moment to really understand the space. With all the buttons, settings, and options like screen sharing, reactions, and chat, it’s easy to feel a bit lost or click the wrong thing at the wrong time. But once you know where everything is and how it works, meetings become a lot smoother—and much less stressful.

Let’s start with how to join a meeting. You can do this through your Outlook calendar, the Teams calendar, or directly from a channel if the meeting was scheduled there. Just click “Join,” and you’ll land on the pre-join screen.

You can also start a meeting directly from a one-on-one or group chat. Just go to the top right of the chat window and click the video icon to start a call, or select “Meet now” if you want to jump into a quick meeting without scheduling it in advance.

And if you want to start a meeting from scratch—maybe to quickly connect with clients or colleagues outside of an existing chat—you can go to the Calendar tab in Teams and click “Meet now.” This gives you full control over who to invite and how to run the meeting, even on short notice.

Having a meeting open, there are many different options to navigate through. First of all, let’s cover the basics and turn your camera and microphone on or off, choose your audio settings, and even apply a background filter if you want to blur your background or use a virtual one.

Sure, here’s a clearer and more polished version of that section, with improved flow and clarity:

You’ll find all the essential controls in the top right corner of the meeting window. Clicking the large camera or microphone icons lets you turn them on or off—as long as you have one connected. If you click the small dropdown arrow next to the camera icon, you can apply background effects or access more video settings.

When you open this side panel, you’ll see a range of background options. You can also upload your own custom background by clicking “Add new.” At the bottom of the panel, there’s a “Preview” button—this lets you see how it looks before others do. If you’re happy with it, click “Apply and turn on video” to make the changes live for everyone in the meeting.

Another key control is the Share button, which sits right next to the microphone. When you click it, you’ll be given a few options for what to share—either your entire screen or just a specific open window.

If you share your whole screen, keep in mind that participants will see everything you see, including notifications or any apps you switch between. If you want to keep things more focused—and avoid showing anything unintended—it’s often better to share just a single window. That way, only the content you’ve selected will be visible to everyone in the meeting. Personally, I prefer sharing a specific window rather than my entire screen—it keeps things cleaner and avoids accidentally showing something you didn’t mean to.

Now let’s look at the rest of the meeting toolbar, moving from left to right across the top of the window.

In the very top left corner, you’ll see a small timer showing how long the meeting has been running. It’s a small detail, but helpful for staying aware of time—especially if you’re in back-to-back calls. Even more useful is the built-in reminder that appears five minutes before the scheduled end time, right in the center of the screen. It’s a gentle nudge to start wrapping things up and helps keep meetings on schedule.

Next, there’s the chat button, which opens the meeting chat on the right-hand side. This is where participants can drop links, ask questions, or comment without interrupting the conversation. You’ll also see time stamps here that show when the meeting started, who joined, and when it ended. Once the meeting ends, the chat stays available in your regular chat list in Teams—so you can always go back and refer to what was shared. If you’re presenting, I recommend checking the chat from time to time. Some people might not feel comfortable speaking up, but they’ll leave questions or feedback in the chat.

Next to that, you’ll see the People button, which opens the participant list. Here, you can see who’s in the meeting and manage their settings. Click the three dots next to any name to mute them, pin their video, or put them in the spotlight so everyone sees their feed as the main one.

There are also two handy features here. First, you can download the attendee list by clicking the three dots in the top-right corner of the participant panel. Second, you can invite someone on the fly during the meeting. Just type their name in the search bar, and you’ll see a list of matches from your organization. Hover over the right name and click “Request to join”—this will call them directly and bring them into the meeting.

I use this a lot when I’m in a one-on-one meeting and need a quick input from someone else. Instead of scheduling a separate call or writing an email, I’ll just add them in real time and get the question resolved on the spot. It saves a lot of back and forth.

Next, there’s the Raise Hand button. Click it to let everyone know you’d like to ask a question or add something to the discussion—your hand will be visible to everyone in the meeting. It’s automatically lowered once you speak, but you can also lower it manually if needed.

Then there’s the Reactions button. This lets you send quick, non-verbal feedback—like a thumbs up, heart, or applause—without interrupting the conversation. Just click a reaction, and the emoji will briefly appear on your video tile for everyone to see.

The View button comes next. It allows you to adjust how the meeting is displayed—switch between Gallery and Speaker view, or explore more layout options at the bottom of the panel. This is useful if you want to focus on who's talking or get a broader overview of participants.

Then there’s the Apps button, which allows you to integrate third-party tools into your meeting. While it’s not commonly used in everyday calls, it can be handy in more advanced setups.

Finally, don’t overlook the More Actions menu—those three dots. This menu includes many important settings: device configuration, meeting recording, language interpretation, and more. I recommend exploring it during a less critical meeting to get comfortable with the features available.

There are still a few features we haven’t touched on, but we’ll walk through those in the next videos.
