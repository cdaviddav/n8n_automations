# Keep Conversations Flowing: Start & Manage Chats
Next up, let’s look at how to start, manage, and organize your chats in Microsoft Teams—so you can keep conversations flowing without losing track of what matters.

Starting a chat in Teams is easy—but managing them well is what really matters. With multiple conversations and projects happening at once, it’s easy to miss details or waste time digging through cluttered threads.

Let’s start with the basics. To create a new chat, go to the Chat section and click the small icon at the top that looks like a square with a pencil. Then type the name of the person—or multiple people—you want to chat with. You can add as many people as you need, but once you include more than one, it becomes a group chat.

If you’ve started a group chat with more than two people, you have the option to name it—though it’s not required. I personally like naming group chats when they’re tied to a specific topic or project. Just click the pencil icon next to the participants' names and select “Name group chat.” It makes the chat much easier to recognize later and saves you from scrolling through a bunch of unnamed threads. I do this for all project-related chats—something like “Project XY – Deal Team”—so I can jump back in quickly when needed.

Once your chat is open, you can send messages just like in any messaging app. But here’s where Teams gets more useful—you can also format messages by clicking the formatting icon at the right of the message box. This opens a mini editor where you can add headings, bullet points, links, and more. I use this whenever I want to share something more structured, like a short update or a to-do list.

You can also share files directly in a chat. Just click the plus icon and choose “Attach file.” You’ll be able to pick from recent files, upload something from your device, or attach a file from OneDrive. Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop a file right into the chat—it’s quick and works just as well.

If a conversation is active or important, consider pinning it—or adding it to favorites, depending on your version of Teams. Just hover over the chat in the sidebar, click the three dots, and choose “Pin,” or select “Move to” and then “Favorites.” This keeps the chat at the top of your list, so it’s always easy to find. I use this for high-priority conversations and frequent contacts—it’s a small change that saves time and keeps things tidy.

You can also pop out any chat into a separate window. Just click the three dots in the upper right corner of the chat and select “Open in new window.” This is really useful if you want to keep a conversation open while working in a channel or reviewing documents.

Now let’s talk about managing group chats. If you’re working with the same people regularly, there’s no need to start a new chat every time—just reopen the existing one. You can add or remove members by clicking the chat name or using the small people icon with a plus sign in the top right. If you remove someone, they’ll still see the old messages but won’t have access to anything new. When adding someone, you can choose whether or not to share the chat history with them.

And finally, if a chat is active but not urgent or relevant right now, you can mute it to avoid constant pop-ups. Just click the three dots next to the chat name and select “Mute.” You’ll still receive messages, but without notifications. The chat will stay in your list, marked with a muted bell icon instead of profile pictures, so you can check in when it suits you.
