# Choose Wisely: OneNote vs. Loop in Teams
Next up: Let’s take a closer look at when to use OneNote and when to use Loop inside Microsoft Teams—so you can pick the right tool for your workflow and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.

You might already be familiar with both tools, but when it comes to using them inside Teams, the lines can get a little blurry. Should you take meeting notes in OneNote? Should you plan projects with Loop? Or maybe do both? In this video, we’ll break down the differences and help you decide which tool makes the most sense for your day-to-day work.

Let’s start with OneNote. Think of OneNote as your digital notebook—structured, organized, and great for long-form content. If you need to keep detailed meeting minutes, build out project documentation, brainstorm ideas across several pages, take handwritten notes, or store information you’ll revisit regularly, OneNote is the way to go. It’s perfect for more formal or long-term knowledge tracking.

Now, Loop is more like a live canvas for real-time collaboration. It’s fast, flexible, and designed for dynamic teamwork. You don’t organize content in notebooks or sections like OneNote. Yes, you also have workspaces and pages, but more importantly, you can use modular blocks called components. These components can be embedded in chats, shared in meetings, and edited by multiple people at the same time, even outside of Teams.

So, Loop works best when the content is evolving, shared across multiple people, and you want to move quickly. For example, you might use Loop to brainstorm ideas during a meeting, plan action steps together, or track tasks in a fluid, fast-moving environment. It’s especially helpful when multiple people are contributing at the same time and you want to stay in the flow of conversation without opening separate apps.

Here’s how I usually draw the line: I use OneNote when I’m working on my own, need more structure, and want to keep information accessible long term. For me, OneNote acts like a personal or team knowledge hub—it stands on its own and is great for content that I’ll revisit over weeks or even months.

On the other hand, I use Loop when I want to collaborate with others seamlessly across different tools like Teams or Outlook, and I need speed and flexibility. If I’m looking to gather quick input from the team or co-create something in real time, Loop is almost always the better choice.

So whatever your use case is, the great thing is that inside Teams, both tools can live side by side. You can add OneNote as a tab in a channel and use Loop components directly in chats or meeting notes. They don’t compete—they complement each other. It’s just a matter of using the right tool for the type of collaboration you’re doing.
